Sydney's worst bushfire crisis in 30 years intensified yesterday as ferocious blazes killed an elderly man, threatened scores of homes and caused gridlock on the roads.

For a third consecutive day flames caused havoc and destruction in bushland neighbourhoods to the north, south and west of the city. About 4,500 firemen battled round the clock to prevent the fires from advancing into the main residential suburbs.

Fires threaten Sydney 
News in brief Winds continued to fan walls of flame and carried embers up to six miles, causing countless fires. In all, 79 were burning across drought-stricken New South Wales.

The body of an 81-year-old man was discovered in his incinerated caravan in Maroota, north of Sydney. His death followed that of an elderly farmer who apparently had a heart attack while trying to save his horses.

More than 20 homes have been destroyed during the three-day emergency and major roads in fire-affected areas have been closed for many hours at a time, causing commuter chaos.

The fires have also caused severe power failures and water shortages, threatened communications and forced the closure of several schools.

Cooler weather is forecast for the weekend, but blistering conditions are due to return on Monday.

Back burning creates smoke haze over Sydney

Sydneysiders woke to the smell of smoke today, as firefighters continued preparations for the opening of the statutory bush fire danger period on October 1.

The smoke haze over the city this morning came from a 373 hectare hazard reduction burn on the Cowan Track in Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park, a fire brigade spokesman said.

The two day burn by the NSW Rural Fire Service (RFS) and National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) is designed to provide strategic protection for Duffy's Forest and Terrey Hills this summer, and RFS spokesman said.

It is also designed to reduce the intensity of any wildfires that may ignite in the Bobbin Head section of the park over the bushfire season.

More smoke is expected over the weekend, from 35 hazard reduction burns planned for a 3,400 hectare area.

An RFS spokesman said hundreds of RFS volunteers were preparing drip torches and firefighting equipment to reduce bushfire fuels in Baulkham Hills, Gosford, Hawkesbury, Sutherland, Warringah Pittwater, Wingecarribee and Wyong.

RFS Commissioner Phil Koperberg said the strategic hazard reduction burns were part of ongoing protection measures for urban areas backing on to bushland.

""We hope the weather conditions are favourable this weekend so we can use the final weeks of mild temperatures for safe, effective hazard reduction burning,"" he said.

Mr Koperberg said only intermittent rain had fallen during during April, May and June with very strong winds also causing problems.

""We are committed to doing hazard reduction, but it will not stop a bushfire completely, so members of the public should also be using this opportunity to prepare their homes properly against bushfires and ember attack before the bushfire season begins,"" the Commissioner said.

The temperature at Observatory Hill in the CBD reached 38.2 degrees Celsius by mid-afternoon, making it Sydney's hottest October day since records began a century and a half ago.

The month's previous hottest day was more than six decades ago - October 4, 1942 - when the temperature in Sydney's CBD peaked at 37.4 degrees.

""I think it's going to be a little bit cooler tomorrow but still fairly hot,"" said a weather bureau spokesman.

Outside the city, some 25 spot fires raged from Nowra on the state's south coast to the central coast and the Hunter Valley.

The worst blaze encroached on the outskirts of several rural properties and seriously threatened hundreds of homes in suburban North Nowra. Two sheds were destroyed.

The blaze, which destroyed over 200 hectares of bushland and was expected to rage overnight, forced the evacuation of at least 50 people.

About 100 firefighters from the NSW Fire Brigades and Rural Fire Service were working into the night to control the flames with the help of three helicopters.

 Another serious inferno, at Morisset near Newcastle north of Sydney, claimed 100 hectares of bushland and threatened the main Sydney-Newcastle rail line, which was closed briefly.

After emergency services were called in about 11am (AEST), about 100 firefighters from the NSW Fire Brigades and Rural Fire Service managed to bring the fire under control by late afternoon.

""Any day like today is going to produce fires of high intensity and they'll also be fast moving,"" NSW Fire Brigades spokesman Inspector Gordon Boath said.

He said the high-risk conditions brought by the heat were made worse by the dryness of the fuel.

SYDNEY, Jan 6 AAP - A fire south of Sydney is continuing to worry fire fighters after 
temperatures soared past 40 degrees in some parts of NSW on Tuesday. 

Firefighters battled a total of nine bushfires across NSW, including a large uncontained 
bushfire in Morton National Park which has been declared an emergency, the NSW Rural Fire 
Service (RFS) says. 

The fire has burnt about 300 hectares of forest since it was sparked on Sunday by a 
lightning strike. No properties are at risk. 

About 20 personnel are fighting the blaze, including firefighters from the RFS, National

Smoke levels were so high in Perth yesterday, medical authorities warned they could prove fatal to people with heart conditions. 

The situation is not going to improve greatly today with the Department of Conservation and Land Management warning easterly winds will push smoke from the blaze over the metropolitan area this morning. 

CALM spokesman Rick Sneeuwjagt says even though the fire is being held within containment lines, there are areas within the 115 kilometre perimeter that are still burning and will continue to produce smoke until the end of the week. 

""We've had the worst of it, but there'll still be a large amount of smoke coming out of the fire for the next day or so,"" he said. 

More than 250 emergency service personnel worked through the night to consolidate containment lines around the fire which has burnt 20,000 hectares of bush over the past five days.

People with health conditions exacerbated by smoke are urged to follow their usual medical advice.

Meanwhile, a $100,000 reward has been announced for information leading to the arrest of those responsible for the bushfire.

Police Commissioner Carl O'Callaghan says arsonists put the lives and properties of many West Australians at risk.

He says investigations into those responsible for the blaze still need more public help.

Strong gusty winds are again fanning wildfires around the state. 

Weary firefighters had a difficult night, with a bizarre combination of weather conditions affecting more than 60 blazes still out of control. 

Rain even fell in some areas, and while lower temperatures are predicted today, winds are expected to strengthen. 

NSW Rural Fire Service (RFS) spokesman John Winter said the major hot spot would again be Sydney's north.

   advertisement 

A fire around Berowra jumped the F3 motorway last night and the worst case scenario would see it head on the path of the 1994 bushfire which destroyed parts of Sydney's north shore. 

""That has caused some significant problems because now we are going to have to chance down into the bush areas to try and contain that fire,"" Mr Winter told ABC radio. 

""Obviously, we would be worried if it jumps the Cowan Creek area (because then it would) follow the general path it did in 1994 - that's obviously something we desperately want to avoid."" 

Mr Winter said a general southerly wind influence should help firefighters to some extent. 

""But still, the potential for spot fires at the moment is quite heavy and that is something that worries us greatly,"" he said. 

The bizarre weather conditions overnight saw rain fall on a troublesome fire in the Blue Mountains, which took the intensity out of the blaze. 

But Mr Winter said one property is believed to have been razed just north of Katoomba. 

Residents around the besieged areas of Glenorie in Sydney's outer north-west worked closely with fire authorities to contain blazes, but it's believed one property was lost in Bay Road, Arcadia. 

""There's a lot of activity through that area, very intense fire behaviour and an ongoing battle around those areas,"" Mr Winter said. 

Southerly winds will continue to push fires along for most of today, he said. 

""But we're going to see more of a westerly influence by about mid-morning before a stronger southerly comes through in the afternoon and it is just going to continue to play havoc,"" he said. 

Fires burning in Sydney's south continued to ""mill around"" bushland, but it posed no substantial threat to property, Mr Winter said. 

""We were quite concerned about the way the fire was threatening property (around Lucas Heights overnight),"" he said. 

""It did actually cross Heathcote Road and went down around the edge of properties, but it was very much a waiting game yesterday and once again we're going to be keeping residents on high alert."" 

Victorian and South Australian crews were on their way to Sydney to lend a hand in the battle, he said. 

Meanwhile, an 18-year-old Glenfield man will face court today charged with setting a bushfire wantonly and recklessly. 

Several abandoned buildings were destroyed after fire swept across the Holsworthy Army base, in Sydney's south west yesterday. 

The man was arrested at his home by Liverpool detectives and officers from Strike Force Tronto, acting on information received from the public. 

He was refused bail and will appear in Liverpool Local Court today.",,,,,,,,,,"http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/12/06/1038950178457.html",,

""At least we didn't lose the lot,"" he said yesterday, contemplating the black, peeling walls, charred ceiling fan and remains of a small Christmas tree in the living room.

As more than 100 fires continued to burn across New South Wales yesterday, police set up a task force to hunt for arsonists believed to have started many of the blazes. The acting state premier, Andrew Refshauge, said those responsible would face the maximum penalty of 14 years in jail. ""We see arson as an atrocious thing,"" he said.

The bushfires have brought misery to thousands of Australians over the festive period, burning down 150 houses, closing road and rail links and cutting electricity supplies to 12,000 properties. About 4,000 people have fled their homes, some of them spending Christmas in makeshift evacuation centres. Sydney was choked by a thick blanket of smoke yesterday and its beaches were covered in ash. Air pollution was said to have reached near-record levels.

The city's southern and western suburbs have been badly hit, as have towns and villages along the New South Wales coast and large swaths of the rural hinterland.

A spokesman for the New South Wales Rural Fire Service, John Winter, said: ""We're basically looking at the entire Sydney fringe being an exposure.""

Many of the fires started in the Blue Mountains, a World Heritage-listed area 40 miles west of Sydney. In Warrimoo, walls collapsed in the intense heat of a fire that surged out of a gully and raced through Mr Allen's street in just 10 minutes. Piles of bricks and strips of twisted metal littered the pavement yesterday.

Around the corner, Cecily and Lance Jackson combed the ash and smouldering rubble of their home. They were thankful to escape with their lives after taking refuge in the laundry just before flames engulfed the house.

Mrs Jackson said: ""We saw this wall of fire coming towards us. We crouched down until the laundry door blew in and there were embers in the room. When the flames broke through two doors and into the passageway, we decided to open the front door and run.""

Yesterday she searched for her engagement ring in what was once her bedroom. ""This is where my bedside table was, I'm hoping the ring will be there,"" she said.

Cooler weather gave some respite to firefighters tackling the blazes for the third consecutive day, but stronger winds are forecast for the weekend and no rain is expected before next week.

The revelation that nature may not be entirely to blame has angered Australians. The tabloid Daily Telegraph called the wildfires ""Devil's work"" and described ""how arsonists put NSW to the torch"". Lightning strikes caused some fires, but police suspect that up to 40 were deliberately lit.

The task force, which will include forensic scientists and psychological experts, will oversee local investigations into the causes of individual fires. No arrests have yet been made.

Mr Refshauge said: ""The idea that somebody should deliberately light a fire is almost beyond comprehension. Life is difficult enough in Australia, we are prone to bushfires. For somebody to add to that is just unbelievable.""

While some people may have set the fires, others are exploiting them. In the Helensburgh district, south of Sydney, houses left empty after families fled have been burgled. In Wollongong, a former coal-mining town to the south, thieves entered a fire station and stole the wallets of three firefighters who were out tackling blazes.

The fires – the worst since 1994, when four people were killed – swept towards Sydney on Christmas Day and spread from north to south along the city's western perimeter, whipped by high winds. Fire units have rushed from one outbreak to the next, fighting the fires valley by valley and ridge by ridge. They are thought to have saved 11,000 properties. Helicopters, hovering in some cases just a few feet above the trees, have been dropping water on the flames after filling their tanks from lakes and swimming pools.

Hundreds of thousands of acres of land have been ravaged, including much of the world's second oldest national park, on Sydney's southern fringe. The Royal National Park was expected to be completely burnt out by the weekend.

The Insurance Council of Australia has calculated the cost of the fires so far at about A$20m (about £7.7m), but warned the final figure could be higher.",,,,,,,,,,"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/australasia/arsonists-blamed-for-spread-of-sydney-bushfires-621314.html",,

By Linda Silmalis and Holly Nott 

SYDNEY, Jan 4 AAP - Twelve days of battling blazes hit home today with medical teams treating rising numbers of fatigued firefighters as the NSW bushfire crisis heads into a third week. 

NSW Rural Fire Service Commissioner Phil Koperberg admitted the state's 15,000-strong crew was beginning to tire after a seemingly endless battle against the infernos. 

But with more horror weather conditions predicted for the weekend, the crisis looks likely to drag on. 

""Morale is high, but they're very tired,"" Mr Koperberg said.

Officials said more than 250 homes have been saved since the crisis began on Christmas eve and that the downtown area was not in danger. In Sydney's centre, however, light white ash fell on office blocks and the smell of smoke permeated air conditioning systems.

About 300 Department of Environment and Conservation fire crews and volunteer brigades worked through the night to contain the 100 kilometre perimeter fire, which has so far razed more than 13,000 hectares of forest and farmland.

Dangerous fire conditions are forecast for tomorrow.

DEC spokesman Terry Maher said firefighters were working to prevent unburnt pockets from flaring up during tomorrow's forecast hot, strong northerly winds.

""The western and eastern edges are good but we still have considerable work to do along the southern boundary,"" Mr Maher said.

""The terrain along this edge is steep in parts and access is difficult . . . we will have to burn out any pockets between the containment lines and the fire.""

The DEC will hold public meetings today to explain their firefighting plans to residents.

All the other fires in and around Perth have now been contained, including at the now re-opened John Forrest National Park, Forrestdale and Hope Valley, in Perth's south, Mandurah, south of the city, and Yanchep, just north of Perth.

A bushfire emergency period has been declared for WA's south, during which no fires can be lit without permission from Emergency Services Minister John Kobelke.

The WA government is offering a $200,000 reward for anyone who provides information leading to the conviction of an arsonist.

An investigation is continuing into the cause of a bushfire at Toodyay, 85 kilometres northeast of Perth, in which 26-year-old school teacher Michelle Mack was killed on Saturday.

Utility company Western Power's Managing Director Doug Aberle has personally contacted Ms Mack's family to apologise after a preliminary investigation found the fire may have been sparked by powerlines clashing in high winds.

Ms Mack died when her car rolled as she attempted to escape the blaze and she was thrown from the vehicle.

""We've had calls from Engadine, Frenchs Forest and Epping, so the haze must be spread over the entire city,"" the spokesman said.

Up to 100 fires are burning in the state of New South Wales (NSW), with 35 out of control. 

Firefighters say their resources are stretched to the limit and are being hampered by strong winds and low humidity. 

In the town of Cessnock, in the Hunter Valley, residents were evacuated from the path of a wall of fire up to 40 metres high. 

Elsewhere between five and 10 homes were burnt down in Mittagong, to the south-west of Sydney. 

Other industrial buildings caught fire and the main highway linking Sydney with the capital Canberra had to be closed. 

""It looks like a war zone,"" one local resident told reporters. 

Thick black smoke hung over Mittagong and residents tried to ward off the flames by drenching gutters and roofs with water, Reuters news agency said. 


Two helicopters water-bombed the blaze but failed to get it under control 

""It's a very difficult situation, with crews reporting firestorm-like activities in the area"", a spokesman for the Rural Fire Service said. 

""Wind gusts of up to 60 kilometres per hour and very low humidity levels are proving a great challenge,"" John Winter said. 

Officials are investigating whether arsonists are to blame for the fire at Mittagong, which is believed to have started in a bush near a road.

Residents in Irish Town and St Marys, which are inland and south of the fire-ravaged town of Scamander, remain on high alert late today as the fire front advances.

A Tasmania Fire Service (TFS) spokesman said the smoke had reduced visibility to just metres in the towns, and roads had been closed.

""(The fire) started inland and the westerly wind yesterday pushed it to the coast ... the big concern now is everything south of the fire,"" said Danny Reid, of the TFS fire management unit.

""It is pushing the fire in the opposite direction down towards St Marys (and) Irish Town.

""If it crosses Elephant Pass and gets into the Douglas Apsley National Park there is nothing to stop it going right through to Bicheno.""

Mr Reid said the front had reached Irish Town late today but was yet to hit St Marys, a major population centre in the state's east with about 600 residents.

But the inferno was moving slower than yesterday, when it was fanned by winds gusting over 110 kilometres per hour, meaning fire crews had enough time to keep ahead of the fire front.

There were about 130 firefighters, 28 tankers, eight bulldozers and two aircraft including a water-bombing helicopter involved in fighting the fire today.

No homes have been lost in the two towns so far, Mr Reid said.

A community meeting was held in St Marys early today with many residents stating they would stay on their properties and face the fire.

""There are quite a few people living in St Marys but in the area immediately around the town there are a lot of houses dotted amongst the bush - residences and holiday homes,"" Mr Reid said of St Marys.

Scamander residents, including panelbeater Aaron McKinnie who lost his shed and three cars he was working on, today described the scenes as the fire tore through their town overnight.

""It was crazy, it just came so fast. One minute it was so far down the road and the next minute it was on my ... back doorstep,"" said Mr McKinnie, who credits his neighbour with saving his home.

""All we did was packed photos in a couple of cars and left.""

The high winds threw sparks one kilometre ahead of the blaze and was strong enough to lift gravel from the roadsides.

There were no reports of deaths but one man was taken to Launceston General Hospital with burns to his arm.

A community audit is underway to tally the damage and total loss of homes.

The Scamander Supermarket today became a meeting place for locals as owner Kevin Love emptied his freezer and fridges of thousands of dollars of goods he can't keep.

""We've been told the power could be off for a couple of days. I'd rather give it away than chuck it away,"" he said.

Tasmanian Premier Paul Lennon today visited fire ravaged streets in Scamander, and pledged government aid for stricken communities.

""This is a terrible situation and I want to reassure the local community that we will stand with them in their hour of need,"" he said in a statement.",,,,,,,,,,"http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/bushfire-threat-to-two-tasmanian-towns/2006/12/12/1165685678605.html",,

Of the 80 fires still burning Friday, all but 10 of them are now under control or in the mopping up stage with milder weather conditions assisting the efforts. 

At one stage last week, more than 100 fires were burning out of control across the state, including two major blazes in Sydney's suburban parklands. 

The main area of concern continues to be on the coast south of Sydney with a 45 kilometer (28 mile) fire front burning in rugged bushland in the Shoalhaven area. 

However, a new fire on the Central Coast of New South Wales, about 80 kilometers (50 miles) north of Sydney, has provided a fresh challenge for overworked fire fighters.

In the absence of any lightning strikes or other obvious causes, the latest blaze is believed to have been deliberately lit. 

More than 30 suspected arsonists have been arrested so far by a NSW police task force with the majority of those believed to be juveniles. 

In the wake of the state's worst fire disaster, the New South Wales Government has unveiled sweeping new legislation aimed at reducing future bush fire hazards. 

The fire crisis, which began on Christmas Eve, has so far razed more than 570,000 hectares (1.2 million acres) of land and destroyed 170 properties. 

The new laws will give the Rural Fire Service the power to enter residential properties to conduct hazard reduction -- such as clearing vegetation away from houses -- without needing the permission of the householders. 

Unco-operative householders will be charged for the work the fire service does. 

The fire service will also be able to undertake hazard reduction in national parks on the same basis. 

The legislation will also strengthen the requirements of local councils to consult with the fire service over residential and other developments in bush fire prone areas. 

The role of councils in bush fire management has been under attack during the latest crisis with reports from householders that some councils had prevented them from undertaking hazard prevention work or made doing the job a bureaucratic nightmare. 

Australian bushland is dominated by eucalyptus trees and other oily trees which catch fire easily in dry weather and burn with great intensity. 

While the fires are a necessary and natural event in Australia, the expansion of city suburbs into native bush areas over the past few decades has increased the damaging impact of the infernos on property. 

Sydney, a city of 4 million people and the commercial capital of Australia, has extensive bushland areas fringing the city and punctuating deep into suburban areas.",,,,,,,,,,"http://edition.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/asiapcf/auspac/01/11/fires.laws/index.html",,

Gusty winds and high temperatures are expected to create hazardous conditions along much of the state's east coast today, ahead of a southerly change this afternoon.

Cameron Wade from the Rural Fire Service says at least 12 crews have been deployed to the Illawarra fire.

""Certainly I've been talking to the crews down there,"" he said.

""They are concerned about that area, but as I said there's heaps of resources there. We're also sending some aircraft down there as we speak to assist those ground crews.""

Although the main fire activity ended on 7 January 2002 following heavy overnight rain around Sydney, the NSW Fire Brigades continued its operations in the South Coast region until 11 January 2002.

Despite these bushfires having been deemed ‘far more ferocious’ than the 1994 fires during which 185 homes were destroyed and 4 lives lost, the NSW Fire Brigades capacity to maintain its normal standards of fire cover, hazmat and rescue response as well as meeting the bushfire commitments was never compromised. 

Then Director of State Operations, Assistant Commissioner Greg Mullins, reported that although the fires of 2001/2002 were in many cases more intense than the 1994 fires, no lives were lost, and far less property damage occurred. This was directly attributable to superior coordination between the services, higher standards of firefighting equipment and personal protective equipment, use of aircraft and coordination of interstate resources, all of which resulted in more effective firefighting operations. 

Inter-agency cooperation also played a vital part in the success of the firefighting campaign. For the first time ever, cross service crewing of appliances took place, with NSW Fire Brigades firefighters relieving Rural Fire Service volunteers on their tankers at Hawkesbury and Wollondilly. The NSW Premier, Bob Carr, praised the efforts of both professional and volunteer firefighters from every State and Territory in Australia and congratulated all those who were involved in fighting the fires.

More than 100 firefighters backed by around 20 trucks and waterbombers were on Thursday night battling to contain fires sweeping through the Beechwood housing estate in Prestons in south-west Sydney.

NSW Fire Brigades spokesman Ian Krimmer said three houses, two of them derelict, were believed to have been burned down as well as several sheds.

""We've still got spot fires that are springing up in the area,"" he said from the scene.

""I wouldn't say it's under control but we're slowly containing it.""


The rapid-moving grassfire jumped the M5 near Camden Valley Way just before 3pm on Thursday, forcing the closure of the motorway for two hours and causing massive traffic jams.

Elsewhere in the state, temperatures in the mid-40s and wind gusts of up to 85kph, combined with low humidity, turned large swathes of country into tinderboxes.

The lakeside town of Wee Jasper, north of the ACT, was surrounded by flames with a large number of homes under threat, said Rural Fire Service spokesman John Winter, although firefighters were ""fairly hopeful"" of saving them.

Villages and communities in the Jindabyne area, south of the ACT, were also on high alert with many residents voluntarily evacuating to the town centre.

However, landscape architect Graham Jones was this evening preparing to defend his home, which was being threatened by an anticipated wind change.

""I feel confident that it was the right decision (to stay) but if it gets too much we'll jump in the car and get away,"" he said from his house outside Jindabyne.

""There's more smoke to the south but it's coming through in droves. It's pretty thick.""

East of the ACT, spot fires jumped the Murrumbidgee River and were threatening Michelago.

The Monaro Highway, the southern gateway to the capital, was closed between the ACT and Cooma.

A scrub fire in Woy Woy on the central coast posed no immediate danger to residents but was possibly heading towards Brisbane Waters national park while there was also a large grass fire in Harden in south-west NSW.",,,,,,,,,,"http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/01/30/1043804464398.html",,

Raised dust, which was widespread in South Australia yesterday, spread across northern Victoria and NSW overnight, arriving in SW Queensland and eastern NSW after dawn this morning. The dust storm was at its worst in western NSW and Queensland, with visibility reduced to 50m in places as fresh dust was whipped up from bone dry soil with reduced vegetation cover and mixed through the lower atmosphere by strong, gusty winds.

Professor Grant McTainsh, a wind erosion specialist at Griffith University Queensland, said ""This is one of the biggest dust storms in the last 20 years, it's enormous. It could easily have tens of millions of tonnes of dust. It was 6km high at Charleville, southern Queensland. That's incredible. Usually, storms stop picking up dust as they move east.

After three days of fearsome fires, which have taken the lives of two fire-fighters, invaded the suburbs of southern Sydney and left more than 600,000 acres devastated, the authorities are preparing for a red alert today. The worst fires were blazing near Coonabarabran, in north-west New South Wales, the Hunter Valley, north of Sydney, and Lithgow, west of Sydney.

But many are asking if Australia is not getting a foretaste of more natural disasters, unless it changes its policy and helps to cut the emission of the greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming.

Fighting and surviving fires is embedded into the Australian psyche. But there is little doubt that Australia is experiencing such tragedies with growing regularity. Few people this year were prepared for a return of fires so soon after the last conflagrations in 1994, when the suburbs in bushland valleys close to the centre of Sydney went up in flames.

The last widespread fires before that were those of ""Ash Wednesday"" in 1983, when 76 people died in the states of Victoria and South Australia; in 1967, when 62 died in Tasmania and on ""Black Friday"" in 1937, which took 71 lives in Victoria.

This year, the fires began even before the official start of the Australian summer in December, getting under way last week during some of the hottest and driest November weather on record.",,,,,,,,,,"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/environment-fires-expose-australias-dirty-record-1286873.html",,

Whipped up by wind blowing across drought-ravaged farms, the dust storm was the worst in about 30 years, weather and environmental experts said. 

Tens of millions of tonnes of valuable topsoil were stripped from bone-dry farms. 

Senior Bureau of Meteorology forecaster Greg Bond said it was the biggest

dust storm he had seen in 30 years in the job and had shown up on satellite photos. 

`The satellite images are quite spectacular, I haven't seen anything so dramatic,' Mr Bond said. 

The bureau said the dust storm was 1500km long and 400km at its widest, while aircraft pilots said it extended 2500 metres into the atmosphere. 

It moved slowly across Victoria and NSW before it hit the Hunter near Scone about 9am, continuing through the region at a speed of about 50kmh. 

The University of Newcastle's Martin Babakan said the severity of the dust haze could be measured by the fact that it managed to cross the ranges and reach Newcastle. 

`It's not often they come this side of the mountains,' Mr Babakan said. 

`But this time it came through just south of Scone and came right down to the coast. 

`You can only expect this on very rare occasions.' 

The dust haze provided a talking point for Hunter residents right around the region. 

From Broke to Newcastle's Hunter Mall it was a similar story. 

`You can't see two feet in front of you up here,' Greg Crowe, of Broke, said late yesterday morning. 

Lunch diners in the Mall had to contend with flying grit. 

A front stretching from Tasmania to Mt Isa in north-west Queensland drove the storm through drought-stricken areas of the country, Professor Grant McTainsh of Brisbane's Griffith University Department of Environmental Sciences said. 

The strong north-westerly wind moved through western NSW and Queensland, cutting visibility down to only a few hundred metres, he said. 

Bringelly, south-west of Sydney, recorded 150 micrograms of dust per cubic metre of air, while a reading of 116 was taken in north-west Sydney.

Tasmania Fire Service chief officer John Gledhill said most of the fires would have been caused by human error.
``They are not lightning generated, I would suggest 90 per cent or more are of human origin,'' he said.
``I have to put it down to carelessness, even negligence.''
And he repeated a statement he made recently that firefighting efforts would be concentrated on the properties that had been properly prepared for bushfires.
Properties which were not adequately prepared were dangerous places to fight fires and these put firefighters at risk, Mr Gledhill said.
The fires causing major concerns were the Kellevie fire which has now burned about 5000ha; a fire at Brittains Rd, Deep Bay; a fire at Couta Rocks near Temma; a fire at Bushrangers Creek, at West Bothwell; a fire at Huntsman Cap, at the back of South Sister near St Mary's, and there is a fire not yet controlled at Henty Main Rd, Zeehan.
The Couta Rocks fire spread south yesterday and the South Sister fire was turned away from properties under threat yesterday afternoon.
Gusty weather made fighting the South Sister fire, which was burning towards Cornwall Coal, hazardous.
Containment lines were being built at Deep Bay for fuel reduction burns overnight last night -- the fire has been burning in steep, hard to access country which has houses.
Mr Gledhill said: ``It's been a reasonable day to get a bit of control but we still have a long way to go.
``My concern is the number of fires we have and the difficulty we have putting them out.
``Long term we are told not to expect any significant rain and we are working on these new fires, and people are starting to get tired.''
He said people could not do firefighting day after day. Facing a potentially long fire season, Mr Gledhill said there would need to be management of fatigued firefighters.
And the dry conditions made putting out fires extremely difficult.
Kellevie fire incident controller Hugh Jones said the temperature peaked much higher and the humidity was lower than expected yesterday with an updated forecast mid-morning predicting a temperature of about 30C by mid-afternoon.
He said: ``We have had a section of the fire jump over a control line at the north-western edge, like yesterday [Saturday] and the fire activity has increased with the fire crowning through the trees.
``We have had fire activity all along the northern edge, in some cases slow moving and in some cases rapidly moving.''
Mr Jones said firefighters were looking forward to improved firefighting conditions forecast for today and tomorrow, although no decent rainfall was forecast.
The conditions would slow down the Kellevie fire but not enough to tackle it head on.
About 60 people fought the fire on the ground yesterday and there were 17 water tankers, bulldozers, and three helicopters water bombing the blaze.
No houses were under threat yet.

Aerial water bombing operations continued throughout the morning, with eight aircraft assisting about 60 ground tankers to focus primarily on back-burning in areas of the Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park.

The Rural Fire Service's main strike weapon, the 9000-litre capacity Erickson Air-Crane, was also on standby.

Yet, unless the unforseen happens, the fire that had managed to blacken more than 800 hectares of parkland had been brought under control, the RFS said.

Residents surrounding the Chase, the city's Pittwater foreshore, Terrey Hills and Duffys Forest should remain vigilant, the service said.

However, the blaze was not threatening those areas directly, mainly due to moderating winds, increased humidity and a mass back-burning effort through Friday night.

RFS Commissioner Phil Koperberg declared the emergency over by lunchtime, saying the easier weather and the work done by his crews and residents had saved the day. 

""A good save all round,"" Mr Koperberg said from the Terrey Hills fire control centre.

""This fire is now largely contained due to the very good work of the firefighters.""

Mr Koperberg said there were about 380 firefighters still on the ground, who would remain on watch for most of the weekend.

He expected a small section of the fire to be contained by midnight at the latest.

""By then we should be able to declare this fire contained,"" he said.

The pre-emptive back-burn under difficult conditions during the previous two days had prevented major loss, although he said hundreds of funnel-web spiders forced out of the undergrowth had ""scared the hell out of an arachnophobe like me"". 

The western side of Ku-ring-gai Chase, including Bobbin Head, was reopened yesterday. However, the eastern section of the park remained closed due to suspect road conditions. The next three to four days, with cooler conditions prevailing and the possibility of rain on Monday and Tuesday, would further lighten the firefighters' load, Mr Koperberg said.

Yet by midweek, a return to adverse conditions was on the cards, with higher temperatures and strengthening north-west winds.

""The focus will be to ensure that the fires we have dealt with in the past few days remain totally contained,"" he said.

Mr Koperberg was joined by Premier Bob Carr and Opposition Leader John Brogden, a Cottage Point patrol volunteer member who spent 12 hours from Friday night until Saturday morning on duty.

Mr Brogden echoed Mr Koperberg's optimism but reminded the public that this fire had arrived almost 10 years to the day since a major blaze tore through the Warringah-Pittwater area.

""We haven't had a major bushfire here for many years and I guess we've been due for one,"" he said.

Mr Brogden had his own brush with danger yesterday morning, ""running blind 60 metres into some bush to put out a fire"", after some embers flared up near Cottage Point.

""It's a hell of a job, it's a bugger of a thing to go in the middle of the bush to put out a couple of embers, but you know it's important because if you don't get that fire out you run the risk of it spreading further,"" he said.

The Premier declared that the state was ""indebted again to the huge volunteer army that saves NSW"".

""There have been no losses,"" he said. ""No losses of lives, no losses of property.""

An investigation into the cause of the blaze was continuing, the RFS said. Suspicions are that it was deliberately lit.

Mr Koperberg said a 600-hectare fire at Wilton, between Picton and Appin to Sydney's south-west, had also all but been snuffed out by the work of 90 crews, 20 tankers and six aircraft during the weekend.

A 2000-hectare fire in the Goonoo forest, north of Dubbo in the state's west, was also fully secured.",,,,,,,,,,"http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/01/10/1073437521046.html",,

The bulk of the fires were concentrated in the North-West, crews working throughout the night to extinguish them.
The District Officer of the Tasmania Fire Service's fire management unit, Paul Salter, said fire crews continued working throughout yesterday to contain fires at Campania, Melrose and Mathinna.
``Fires caused by lightning strikes in such large numbers are uncommon in Tasmania,'' Mr Salter said.
``Continuing hot and dry conditions may see more fires emerge in remote areas over the next day or two.''
The weather bureau has issued fire weather warnings for the East Coast, the Midlands and the Derwent Valley.
High temperatures and low humidity will make fires in dry vegetation difficult to control.
There was a very high fire danger warning for inland eastern Tasmania last night.
The bureau has forecast fine weather for today, with drizzle and fog expected around eastern and southern areas this morning.
While mild to warm weather is predicted around the state until Sunday, some rain is also expected, although to a lesser extent on the East Coast.
Launceston can expect hotter weather than most cities for the next few days, where it is expected to reach 30C today. Temperatures into the high 20s are forecast until Sunday.
Overnight temperatures around the state will range from 14C to 19C, mostly resting between 16C and 18C.
Mr Salter said the possible showers forecast for later in the week would provide relief for firefighters.
Forestry Tasmania and the Parks and Wildlife Service have deployed firefighting crews to remote areas in the North-West, to attend to blazes caused by lightning strikes.
Wielangta Rd, closed because of wildfire late last year, has been re-opened to the public.
Motorists are advised to drive with caution through the burned areas of the forest.
Ongoing work will mean intermittent closures of the road in coming months.

With a quarter of the State under severe threat, more than 400,000 hectares ablaze and extreme weather forecast for today, officials fear the crisis will worsen. 

Yesterday, 3,500 firefighters were forced to abandon all efforts to contain bushfires and instead focus on saving homes and property from Grafton to Batemans Bay. 

The entire Hunter region - from Singleton to the Central Coast - as well as the northern and southern bushland outskirts of Sydney, the Royal National Park, and the South Coast and North Coast are under severe threat. 

As extra volunteer firefighters and equipment from the defence forces and interstate poured into NSW last night, local firefighters and emergency services braced for the worst day of the season - temperatures are expected to reach the low 40s in some areas with north-westerly winds gusting to 40 km/h. 

Last night, police for the first time banned all traffic from travelling to, from or through the Central Coast except for essential service vehicles and residents. 

Roads were also closed at Turramurra - where three houses were destroyed as fires raged in the Lane Cove National Park - as well as at Menai, south of Sydney, where another big fire broke out last night. 

A 13-year-old boy has been ordered to appear in Hornsby Children's Court in connection with the Lane Cove fire. 

A fire in the Royal National Park burning on a 12-kilometre northerly front forced evacuations from Bundeena and Maianbar on the southern shore of Port Hacking. 

Late last night firefighters reported that two houses at Bundeena had been destroyed and one at Maianbar. The National Parks and Wildlife Service workshop at nearby Audley was also burnt out. 

Lifesavers from Cronulla used surfboats to evacuate children from camps in and around another park settlement, Warumbul, under masses of thick brown smoke, visible all around Sydney. 

Police were investigating reports that the fire had been deliberately lit and might be linked to other fires on Wednesday in the north-west corner of the park. 

By 1.30 pm the fire had destroyed about seven square kilometres of the park and Bush Fire Service officers feared that this area might double overnight. 

There were evacuations in the Hawkesbury townships of Central Mangrove and Spencer as fires approached through the Dharug National Park. 

On Sydney's upper North Shore, a fire started about 11 am at Browns Waterhole in Lane Cove National Park and burnt in three directions -Marsfield, South Turramurra and West Pymble. 

By midday at Marsfield, the flames reached the doors of townhouses and apartments in Busaco Road as firefighters asked hundreds of people to leave their homes, including a block of 58 serviced apartments. 

As residents were told to get their cars out, many people went into shock. Several townhouses were damaged, but property was reported lost last night. 

In West Pymble, one house was destroyed and several others were threatened in Combe Place and Gloucester Avenue. One firefighter received serious internal and spinal injuries when a tree fell on him. 

A fire zone commander, Mr Bob Dobson, said volunteer firefighters would remain in the Lane Cove National Park last night as spot fires continued to flare. 

The NSW Bush Fire Services Commissioner, Mr Phil Koperberg, last night described the conditions as unprecedented.

Sydney, the country's largest city with a population of 4 million, was cut off last night as fires surrounded the city on three fronts: the Central Coast district to the north, the Blue Mountains in the west and the Royal National Park south.

The national park, Australia's oldest, was completely destroyed, leaving a death trail of kangaroos, possums, birds and other wildlife. More than 100 fires were out of control along a 600-mile front, stretching from the Queensland border in the north to the coastal town of Bateman's Bay in the south. About 5,000 firefighters from other states and hundreds of troops were flown in yesterday to help thousands of state firefighters, many of them volunteers, stave off further catastrophe.

Temperatures of more than 100F and hot, dry winds turned yesterday into Black Friday for Australia's most populous state, confirming the worst fears of firefighters who have spent three days and nights trying to control the infernos.

As thousands of people were evacuated from towns and suburbs, Terry Griffiths, the New South Wales Minister for Emergency Services, said: 'We have given up fighting the fires. We're fighting now to save lives and property.'

Fires moved south from the Central Coast, a popular seaside resort area packed with thousands of holidaymakers, and jumped the Hawkesbury River late yesterday then moved into Sydney's wealthy northern suburbs, located in tinder dry bushland. As darkness fell, houses began exploding in flames in the suburbs of Turramurra, Wahroonga and Lindfield, Sydney's stockbroker belt. For most of yesterday, the city was covered by an eerie red glow from palls of smoke blocking out the sun. Fires engulfed houses in the south coast fishing village of Sussex Inlet where a nursing home was evacuated.

Authorities confirm that some fires were deliberately lit. Police yesterday arrested a 13-year-old boy and charged him with lighting a fire in the Lane Cove National Park in northern Sydney.

The state-wide fires began in isolated blazes earlier this week, and were quickly fanned into flames 80ft high by several days of high temperatures, hot winds and low humidity - the ideal conditions for bushfires to take hold. By last night, they had wiped out almost one million acres of forest and bushland. So far three people have died, including two firefighters. Amateur glider pilots reported high ash clouds blowing over New Zealand, 940 miles across the Tasman Sea.

Brian Howe, the acting Prime Minister, yesterday paid tribute to the firefighters for containing the losses of life. Phil Koperberg, the New South Wales Bush Fire Services Commissioner, said: 'We should have lost much more property by now. Their sheer commitment, determination and bloody-mindedness has prevented it.'

After last night's conflagrations in suburban Sydney, however, the losses are likely to go much higher, especially as no let-up in the blistering weather conditions is expected before late tomorrow. Past bushfires in Australia have caused greater losses, particularly the Ash Wednesday fires of 1983 in Victoria and South Australia in which 75 people died and 2,500 homes were destroyed. But no fire has engulfed a wider area, including a major city, in such an uncontrollable way as the latest disaster.

The Rural Fire Service (RFS) is placing more personnel at fire fronts on the state's north coast in preparation for increasing winds this afternoon.

Containment lines are being extended around a large blaze south-west of Kempsey that has burnt out about 2,000 hectares and threatened houses last night.

Further north, fires are still burning near Lismore in the Richmond, Clarence and Bellinger Valleys.

RFS spokesman John Winter says crews from outside the region may be called in to help if the weather deteriorates.

""We'll certainly be scaling crew up and we'll be attempting to ensure that a maximum number of crew are on the ground for each of the fires,"" he said.

""Obviously there is going to be weather factors that will play a determination on whether or not we'll have to add to what will already be a large contingent because we are expecting a busy afternoon.""

A pile of burning logs left unattended in yesterday's gusty winds has been blamed for the Kempsey blaze.

RFS spokesman Mike Donohoe says no action will be taken against the person burning the logs.

""There was a permit for the fire, it's just unfortunate gusty winds blew up and ignited the bushfire,"" he said.

Fire-fighters are battling a number of bushfires around Sydney.

Police have closed Henry Lawson Drive at Picnic Point in Sydney's south-west after a fire broke out in the Georges River National Park.

The fire is moving north towards Transgrid's electricity Sydney South Substation.

A spokesman for the company says its officers are monitoring the situation.

Meanwhile, fire brigade and RFS officers are fighting a blaze south of Penrith in Sydney's west.

Northerly in bushfire scare
December 17 2002
By Tony Bourke





Australia's champion racehorse Northerly had to be moved to safety yesterday as a bushfire raged through part of the property of trainer Fred Kersley at Forrestdale, 25 kilometres south of Perth.

The fire, which apparently started near the front gate of the Kersley property, did not reach the house or stables, but a nearby 40-hectare paddock, from which 40 horses had to be removed, was burnt out.

More than 10 fire units and a water plane were called in to fight the blaze, which began in the late morning and was brought under control about two hours later.

Six-year-old Northerly, who won his second Cox Plate during the spring as well as the Caulfield Cup, returned to Kersley's stables only last Friday after spelling at part-owner Neville Duncan's Oakland Park Stud at Busselton, further south of Perth, where he was reared.",,,,,,,,,,"http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/12/17/1039656390991.html",,

As temperatures soared to 30C in the city and 38C at the coast, the blazes were an ominous warning for the coming bushfire season, which already is predicted to be severe.

A blaze that started yesterday afternoon near Kempsey had burnt out 1500 hectares by nightfall and was threatening the 20 semi-rural homes south-west of the town centre.

Homeowners fought side-by-side with 18 fire crews and Port Macquarie firefighters reinforced local teams.

Temperatures on the North Coast edged towards 40C and winds swept at 50 kilometres per hour. Though conditions eased with nightfall, high temperatures and gusty winds are expected again today.


Rural Fire Service spokesman Cameron Wade said yesterday: ""We'll have even more people there by tomorrow.""

Other fires were burning in Grafton, Bellingen, Maitland, Wauchope, Dungog, Cessnock, Blacktown and Penrith. 

Sydney's first serious fire of the season broke out in grassy land at Marsden Park in the west at around 2pm. By nightfall the 100-hectare fire had been contained by firefighters who backburned behind nearby homes.

Sydney city was not spared strong winds or unseasonable heat either, with the temperature reaching 30C, almost 10C above average for this time of year.

Another smaller fire began in scrub at Quakers Hill, diverting some of the 15 tankers and crews at work, though only for a short time.

Asked if he thought the fires had been deliberately lit, Mr Wade said: ""Well, there weren't any lightening strikes out there.""

For months the Rural Fire Service has been warning people that its main indicator of seasonal fire danger, the Southern Oscillation Index, shows this year's season will be more dangerous than last year.

""Every time there is a bad fire season you can see a trough on the graph,"" he said. 

""It happened in 1994, it happened last year. And the trough which we are in now is even bigger."" 

A Bureau of Meteorology senior meteorologist, Phil King, said the scale it uses to measure moisture in the bush had already hit 10, the driest mark. Yesterday's humidity was just 13 per cent. ""Anything under 20 per cent is bad news,"" he said.

A total fire ban has been declared for the greater Sydney region, and the Rural Fire Service has advised people in bushfire prone areas to take precautions.

""They should be clearing any fuel, clearing leaves from their gutters and working out an evacuation plan,"" said Mr Wade.",,,,,,,,,,"http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2002/09/26/1032734228572.html",,

The Environment Protection Authority (EPA) has issued a no-burn order covering Sydney and surrounding regions for today. It is likely to be extended to cover the weekend. 

Health authorities have warned asthmatics to take precautions. 

The pollution was particularly bad in the eastern suburbs. Early yesterday, the pollution index for eastern Sydney reached 232, compared with 245 at the height of the January 1994 bushfires. 

In the south-west it reached 222, and in the north-west 90. Anything above 50 is regarded as high. 

The problem was caused mostly by smoke from massive burns in the Sutherland, Wollongong and Southern Highlands regions, blown over Sydney by a southerly wind on Wednesday night. 

The NSW Fire Brigade headquarters received hundreds of calls from people alarmed by the smoke, which blanketed the city all day. 

Bush fire authorities have taken full advantage of the State's long, dry run - it has not rained in Sydney since July 17 - and cold, calm weather, which has provided them with the best environment in years for controlled burning. 

The Director-General of the NSW Department of Bush Fire Services, Mr Phil Koperberg, said ""tens of thousands of hectares"" of bushland throughout NSW would be torched by the start of summer. 

""More (controlled burning) has been done this year than in any single year for the past 10 years - 10 times more,"" Mr Koperberg said. 

""We learned the lessons of not doing it in January '94 and now, with strict legislation and pragmatic programs, we are doing it properly. It's as much to protect the environment as it is to protect us and our assets. 

""We liaise very closely with the EPA and the Bureau of Meteorology, and we don't blatantly burn when there is a clear potential for blanketing out major population centres, but sometimes the conditions change once we have started the process, and you can't stop it."" 

A spokesman for Hornsby Fire Service said undergrowth surrounding homes near Pennant Hills Park had not been burnt for 30 years.",,,,,,,,,,"http://newsstore.smh.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?page=1&sy=smh&kw=sydney+and+smoke&pb=all_ffx&dt=selectRange&dr=entire&so=relevance&sf=text&sf=headline&rc=20&rm=200&sp=nrm&clsPage=1&docID=news950810_0040_6657",,

This was not just pollution. This was bushfire. 

The people of the bush, or in the suburbs that fringe the bush, had spotted the danger sooner. 

Some up around Narrabri had noticed kangaroos and even emus searching for the patches of green grass left beside bush roads. The animals of the Australian coat-of-arms are not just pretty faces but shrewd observers of the harsh land. 

Most Sydneysiders went off to work, however, comforted by a maximum temperature forecast of only 27C. Many went into air-conditioned offices and only discovered the horrible day when they came out at lunchtime, with the temperature about 10C above the forecast, the air sooty and their fellow citizens cursing silently at the smoky sun. 

There were 130 bushfires across the State, said a newsreader, most out of control. Make that 150, said another. Two hundred, said a third; 400 a fourth. Surely, there couldn't be that many. Was NSW on fire? 

Well, one blaze outside Coonabarabran was burning on a 200-kilometre front and fires don't come much bigger than that. 

After several days of menace and threat, the fires had shown their blazing hand. 

Two firefighters were dead near Lithgow, Premier Bob Carr had given emergency powers to NSW Bushfire Commissioner Phil Koperberg and warned worse was to come, 600 children were evacuated from a school at Illawong and old people from a nursing home at Normanhurst, houses burnt down in Bradman Street, Menai, and Australia's one-day cricket captain Steve Waugh hosed his house down at nearby Alfords Point. The Lucas Heights nuclear reactor, a symbol of the modern times, was closed in deference to fire. 

Heartbreak had touched Australians of the city and the bush alike last night, but it is always more frightening when bushfires threaten a modern city like Sydney. There might be a lesson here for citizens of the city, a lesson in the power of nature. 

One lesson repeated every time bushfires rage is the speed with which the fire leaps rivers and ridges, races up hills, hurls its firepower in fury at homes and showers burning debris on those below. Another is the way in which the fire picks out homes seemingly at random, taking one here, missing the next, taking the next in a macabre dice game. 

Those who lost their homes yesterday will feel they have been violated, like a wound to the body. They will pick through the ruins of their past, asking questions of the future. 

Those who have survived may put it down to a miracle. Those who do not believe in miracles will put it down to courage, preparation, hard work, good sense and some luck. 

Everyone will expect inquiries. Everyone will expect the authorities to do better next time. For the criticism and the questioning are part of Sydney and part of Australia, as inevitable as nature and bushfires themselves.",,,,,,,,,,"http://newsstore.smh.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?page=1&sy=smh&kw=sydney+and+bushfire&pb=all_ffx&dt=selectRange&dr=entire&so=relevance&sf=text&sf=headline&rc=20&rm=200&sp=nrm&clsPage=1&docID=news971203_0048_6861",,

The Asthma Foundation of NSW warned that Sydney's smoke-filled skies could trigger severe attacks in asthmatics and those suffering from respiratory diseases. 

And the NSW Department of Health advised people sensitive to smoke to stay indoors where possible and to limit strenuous exercise. 

Pollution in Sydney's north-west climbed to 200 yesterday after peaking at 221 the day before at levels four times the acceptable limit. A pollution index of 50 is considered high. 

Over eastern Sydney, pollution levels rose from a low of 18 to 69, and in the south-west they dipped slightly from a reading of 84 on Monday to 60 yesterday afternoon. 

Wallsend in Newcastle, which has been affected by fires raging at Wollombi and Toronto, recorded an even higher pollution reading of 244, up from a low of 24 the day before. 

Smoke particles, carried from Sydney's northern suburbs and the Hunter by north-easterly winds, were believed responsible for the high pollution readings in Sydney this week. 

At 9 am yesterday, visibility in the Sydney CBD was reduced to four kilometres and three kilometres at Richmond, in Sydney's outer west. 

Strong easterly winds had served to dissipate most of the smoke by mid-afternoon, the Bureau of Meteorology said.

Around 70 bushfires are still burning around New South Wales.

In the north, around Bellingen, Taree and Casino, fightfighters are in home-protection mode.

Rural Fire Service spokesman Cameron Wade says they are urging residents in bushfire-prone areas to start preparing for the worst as a precaution.

""People need to make sure that if they've got any combustable materials, such as dried leaves, timber piles and so forth, removed from around their home and ensure that they are ready to leave if they're asked to or if they can't cope with the stress that the bushfire may cause,"" he said.

An estimated 12,000 hectares of bush was destroyed, mostly in northern NSW, and four fires were still out of control last night. Two fires in the Severn Council area were causing the most concern, and eight others in the area had been contained. 

Bushfire brigade, NSW Fire Brigades and National Parks and Wildlife Service officers spent two hours containing a small fire at Balgowlah Heights, on the northern shore of Sydney Harbour. 

The blaze, which started at 1 pm, was running along a clifftop and, until the wind shifted direction, officers were worried it would race uphill towards Balgowlah Heights. 

The ferocity of yesterday's fires was blamed on hot winds blowing in from central Australia, averaging 70 km/h at times, and gusting up to 85 km/h. 

The worst of the winds blew through Sydney and the Central Coast shortly after 5 am, felling trees and electricity lines, damaging seven houses and cutting power to about 7,000 more. Most power was restored by mid-morning. 

The Gosford, Hornsby and Hawkesbury areas were all hit, said Mr Pat Clague, operations officer at the State Emergency Services. The jobs of volunteers working for the service would be made easier if residents trimmed branches around their homes, Mr Clague said. 

The winds were expected to ease early this morning and give the firefighters some reprieve. However, the assistant commissioner of NSW Bush Fire Services, Mr Tony Gates, said the bushfire season would undoubtedly get worse. 

Unlike last year, when most large fires were over by Christmas, fires could be expected well into January and February, he said. 

Yesterday's outbreak kept crews busy but it was ""easier than it could have been"", Mr Gates said. 

""It was a typical bad bushfire day - we had high temperatures and strong winds, but the cloud cover kept humidity fairly high, so we didn't have everything dry up."" In Sydney, the temperature reached 33, with similar temperatures in the north of the State. 

Last night, Bush Fire Services advised the State Government to call off the total fire ban. When it was in force yesterday, much of NSW was under a total ban, with all firespotting towers manned and bushfire crews in Sydney and the Hunter region on standby. 

At Loftus Bush Fire Brigade, on the fringes of the Royal National Park, three brigade volunteers were on standby awaiting the unit's call-up. The brigade captain, Mr Rod Evans, said a crew could be pulled together in as little as seven minutes. 

If needed, 12 volunteers could be called by pager, and 38 other members of the brigade could follow soon after. 

Loftus had a close call with bushfire in January 1994, and locals were willing to give up a lot of their time to help the brigade, Mr Evans said. 

Preventing fire plays a major part in Mr Evans's life: after he finished at the bush fire brigade he headed off to work - at the Sydney Airport Fire Brigade. 

Volunteer firefighting was satisfying, he said, but it meant giving up at least 17 Sundays a year for training, as well as time for weekday courses.",,,,,,,,,,"http://newsstore.smh.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?multiview=true&sy=smh&page=1&kw=sydney+and+bushfire&pb=all_ffx&dt=selectRange&dr=entire&so=relevance&sf=article&rc=10&rm=200&sp=nrm&clsPage=1&hids=&sids=news961203_0041_3512",,

PERTH, Jan 22 AAP - Firefighters are still battling to contain a bushfire on the eastern
outskirts of Perth, with fears that shifting winds tomorrow could further stretch their
resources.

The blaze, deliberately lit, has since Sunday burnt 27,000 hectares in the Perth Hills

out near the northern suburb of Carramar, threatening a pine plantation.

Such controlled burns are extensively carried out on an annual basis in spring, early summer and late autumn by the Western Australian Department of Conservation and Land Management (CALM) in the southwest forests, in order to reduce flammable fuels and mitigate the undesirable social, economic, environmental and human problems caused by destructive
wildfires. In this article, results are presented from a mesoscale model prediction of smoke trajectories from a controlled burn event that took place in November, 1995. In this example, two meteorological factors, a strong sea-breeze front and a mesoscale low pressure system, unexpectedly turned the smoke back from its initial trajectory over the ocean to directly over Perth itself. The result was very high smoke concentration levels over the city and associated health concerns to residents as well as disruption
to transport including the closing of Perth airport.

Firefighters were on full alert in Sydney throughout the day, extremely unusual for this time of year, according to the NSG Bush Fire Service. 

Many winter hazard-reduction burn-offs planned in forests and wilderness areas by various land management agencies, such as the National Parks and Wildlife Service and local councils, were called off because of fears of major bushfires. 

The unseasonal heat, combined with low humidity, plenty of fuel and strong north-westerly winds, reaching gales in some inland and coastal areas, brought total fire bans in the Hunter and Central Tablelands regions. 

The bans ran until midnight last night but the Acting Bush Fire Commissioner, Mr Anthony Gates, said the forecast for the next two or three days - warm and dry inland - would tend to exacerbate the situation, with continuing adverse factors, including dust storms. 

Severe dust storms hit Albury-Wodonga and the far south-west of NSW yesterday as South Australia cleaned up after Tuesday's dust storm which covered the Adelaide region and cut visibility to zero on many roads. 

The CSIRO estimated that the storm cost about $40 million, representing about $2 to replace each of the 20 million tonnes of topsoil blown away.

WA: Fresh fears for Perth bushfire as weather outlook worsens 

By Heather Quinlan 

PERTH, Jan 20 AAP - Fears grew tonight that Perth's worst bushfire in 45 years will 
break containment lines and again threaten suburban properties, with hot, windy weather 
conditions forecast for the weekend. 

Around 300 fire personnel were still battling the massive, 25,000 hectare blaze in 
Perth's eastern hills area today, with thick smoke expected to smother the city for at 
least the next two days. 

Firefighters, four water-dumping helicopters and 70 fire trucks were being used to 
shore up the fire's southern boundary, which was expected to be hit hard by rising",,,,,,,,,,"http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-104545028.html",,

Australia's bushfire season officially opens on Oct. 1 and runs until February, but firefighters have been battling blazes for two months already.

On Tuesday, soaring temperatures, strong winds, and low humidity fanned the bush and grass fires in drought-striken New South Wales and in suburban Sydney. There were 47 fires near Sydney alone.

""It's a timely reminder to us, I think, that New South Wales, being one of the most fire-prone areas in the world, is not going to escape the impact of a drought such as we are currently experiencing,"" New South Wales fire commissioner Phil Koperberg said.

At least 10 homes were destroyed in Sydney's southern suburb of Engadine. Another 11 homes were severely damaged in north-west. No one was injured.

Those fires have now been contained, but about 70 are still burning along Australia's tinder-box dry east coast.

""The plan for today is to go in and mop these fires up. They are all but contained around Sydney. Obviously there is a lot of work to do on the fires in the rest of the state,"" John Winter from the New South Wales Rural Fire Service said on Wednesday.

While many of the fires were sparked by lightning strikes over the past week, authorities suspect some of the fires may have been accidentally or deliberately set.

In Engadine, police are investigating reports a maintenance crew may have sparked a fire while using power tools to fix water pipeline leaks.

Sydney Water has launched its own investigation into maintenance work, and said it would compensate families if it was found to be at fault.

The drought in New South Wales, compounded with El Nino weather and Sydney's third driest weather on record could contribute to one of the worst bushfire seasons on record.

No lives have been lost, but an estimated 170 homes have been burned. 

The worst of the fires is threatening the towns of Woodford and Faulconbridge in the Blue Mountains west of Sydney. Some fires in Sydney's northern suburbs have been contained, but smoke hangs over the city and nearby Albion Park.

In view of the weather forecast for high summer temperatures, low humidity and strong winds, Rural Fire Service Commissioner Phil Koperberg says there is no end in sight to the bushfires. He has declared a total fire ban for the entire state of New South Wales - no fire of any kind may be lit in the open. 
More than 70 aircraft are still dropping water and fire retardant on the stubborn bushfires that broke out on Christmas Day. 

Hundreds of firefighters have been treated for injuries, and close to 50 have been taken to hospitals. On Thursday, one firefighter battling a blaze near Oberon, west of the Blue Mountains, was rushed to hospital with burns to his feet.

Many of the fires appear to have been deliberately set. Police have arrested 23 arson suspects, most are male teenagers, but a 14 year old girl was arrested yesterday. 
New South Wales Premier Bob Carr told reporters he plans to take young arsonists ""by the scruff of the neck"" and make them face the horror of what they had done. 

To finally douse the fires, Australian officials have pinned their hopes on help from the United States in the form of two large firefighting helicopters from Erickson Air-Crane Inc. of Central Point, Oregon. They are renting the two choppers that can take up 3,500 gallons of water in 45 seconds and release it to douse the flames. But a record snowstorm in Atlanta, Georgia yesterday grounded the Antanov cargo plane chartered to fly the Air-Cranes from Oregon to Sydney.

Minister for Emergency Services, Bob Debus, who represents the Blue Mountains in the New South Wales Parliament, said the local authorities should be helped to improve procedures for burning off excess forest fuels in advance of the summer bushfire season. 
Since the bushfires broke out, 400 State Emergency Service (SES) volunteers have been supporting the Rural Fire Service removing dangerous trees, securing hazardous buildings, readying for evacuation. ""Every volunteer on one of our crews in the field has, at a minimum, training in general rescue, teamwork, working with the public, first aid and radio communication,"" said Mim Humphries, SES deputy division controller for the Sydney Southern Division, who has been coordinating SES assistance from the Rural Fire Service Incident Management Centre at Picton. 

The NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service is currently managing 50 bushfires on national parks and reserves. Fires are burning on at least 355,000 hectares (877,205 acres) of protected bushland. One of the parks on fire is Blue Mountains National Park, part of the massive Greater Blue Mountains World Heritage Area which contains.

The Blue Mountains area has one of the highest numbers of threatened plant species in Australia. Some species are found nowhere else in the world. More than 90 different eucalypt species are found in the Greater Blue Mountains – 13 percent of all eucalypt species in the world. The blue mist covering the landscape is produced by the eucalypt forests, which release fine droplets into the air. 
Throughout the state’s pine plantations, state forests’ staff is on alert for fires, manning fire towers, fire control rooms and various field locations where fire fighting units are positioned. 

State Forests’ Monaro regional manager, Graham Gray said, State Forests’ staff would be on their toes to protect life, property and the state’s valuable softwood resource throughout this fire season, which could last until April.

Three helicopters and two fixed-wing aircraft helped firefighters contain the blaze.

Two houses in Persimmon Place caught alight, with one destroyed and another significantly damaged, FESA said in a statement.

Firefighters fear the blaze could flare up again because of today's intense weather conditions, said Fire and Emergency Services Authority spokesman Craig Waters.

Already, Perth is choking from the worst pollution ever recorded in the city - caused by a smoke haze which has blanketed the metropolitan area since Wednesday.

The Hills fire is the worst in Perth in 45 years.

FESA said today it was keeping a full fire-fighting crew in the Hills.

""It is a big worry with the high temperatures and the gusty winds,"" Mr Waters said.

""The possibility of the fire flaring up and restarting is very real.""

Perth is expected to top 40 degrees today.

Yesterday, a new task force of firefighters from the volunteer bush fire brigade and the Conservation and Land Management department joined career firefighters in 24 fire-fighting vehicles to patrol the blaze.

AdvertisementThe fire had threatened hundreds of homes in semi-rural areas including Mundaring, Chidlow, Sawyers Valley, and Mahogany Creek, prompting warnings to residents living within 100 metres of bushland to remain on alert for further outbreaks.

For the past few days, Perth has been shrouded in smoke as firefighters work round the clock to consolidate containment lines ahead of the predicted rise in temperatures this weekend.

The smoke haze that has blanketed the metropolitan area since Wednesday was yesterday confirmed as the worst pollution ever recorded in the city.

The Department of Environment's air quality division said the smoke pollution levels were, at times, more than twice the national standard of 50 micrograms per cubic metre.

Meanwhile, officers also battled a bushfire in Perth's northern suburbs overnight that is believed to have been deliberately lit.

The fire at Carramar broke out about 3pm (WST) yesterday, nearby to a pine plantation, Mr Waters said.

Although no homes were threatened by the blaze, officers would have had a hard job fighting the fire if it had reached the plantation, he said.

""Fortunately, it was brought under control and we have crews there now mopping up but the pine plantation was under threat at one stage,"" he said.

It is believed the blaze was also deliberately lit.

SYDNEY - For nearly a fortnight, vast bushfires have been closing in on Sydney. Now residents are asking the unthinkable: is it too late to stop the inferno?

The fire gods are laughing. They watch as mortals scurry to fight an unequal battle against an elemental force threatening to devour the fruits of their carefully constructed lives.

The firefighters dash from place to place. Each time they appear to be getting the upper hand, the gods snap their fingers and shower yet more flames across the landscape.

These are terrifying times in eastern New South Wales. Each day brings more bad news as the wildfires, raging since Christmas Eve, spread out of control and fresh fires start in new spots.

There is fire in the mountains, fire on the coast and fire in the Sydney suburbs, just 16km from the Opera House. The city is choked by a pall of smoke and locals wear gauze masks as they jog on the beaches.

In northwestern Sydney, flames licked at some of the city's most exclusive properties after a blaze that broke out on New Year's Day raced along a corridor of parkland. 

In one backyard, three men wearing bandanas across their faces crouched by a swimming pool, desperately scooping out water with buckets and throwing it on to burning bushes.

More than 80 bushfires are blazing around the state, each unpredictable. With the hot, dry winds that are the ally of the bushfires forecast to continue, no respite is in prospect for exhausted firefighters and demoralised residents.

The smoke, combined with daily temperatures of 38 degrees, has created a feeling of claustrophobia as nature crowds in on Sydney. Outside the city, the magnificent Australian bushland is a scorched mess.

The worst effects - smoke inhalation, stress, minor burns - have been felt by those on the front line: the firefighters, most of them volunteers, who have poured into New South Wales from around Australia. 

No human lives have been lost, but tens of thousands of sheep and native animals, including wombats and kangaroos, have been killed.

Neither the forces of nature nor the gods are entirely to blame for the crisis gripping Australia's most populous state.

Police said a home in a city suburb near the frontline of the battle against the bushfires, which just managed to escape being engulfed in flames, was struck by lightning on Tuesday evening and burned to the ground.

Fanned by high summer temperatures and strong winds, the fires began in earnest on Christmas Day and destroyed at least 110 homes near Australia's largest city before being brought more or less under control earlier this month.

Thousands of voluntary firemen were drafted in to help regular emergency services staff combat the flames, which charred an area of bush almost three times the size of Greater London, or more than 500,000 hectares.

Perth residents are being warned the city could again find itself blanketed in a smoke haze in the coming months.

Smoke from a fire in the south-west covered the city this morning, prompting a Western Australian Health Department warning for people with respiratory and heart conditions to remain inside where possible.

While it is believed the fire was lit deliberately, the Department of Conservation and Land Management (CALM) says its prescribed burning program could cause similar problems.

CALM spokesman Rick Sweeuwjagt says prescribed burns are not carried out unless the right conditions are in place, but subtle changes in wind direction can cause unforseen problems.

He says CALM hopes to carry out extensive burns in the coming months.

""If conditions will allow then we aim to have a good program for the next six to eight weeks, but weather permitting of course, we do need a bit of rain before we can start doing burning in the northern part of the forest,"" he said.

The Department of Environment says today's haze has been cleared by stronger than expected south-easterly winds.

NSW Rural Fire Service spokesman John Winter said 62 fires were currently burning throughout the state, including on the Newnes Plateau near Lithgow, from Gosford to Wyong, and from Yass through the Snowy Mountains and beyond into Victoria.

Although 20 of the fires were still uncontained, none were currently threatening property, he said.

Fire fighters were last night working to contain a large bushfire north of Sydney after fires erupted around NSW during hot weather and gusty winds.

A Rural Fire Service spokesman said crews were trying to establish containment lines around a fire in the Jilliby Nature Reserve which was burning about 6 kilometres to the north-west of Ourimbah, on the Central Coast.

He said if the fire crossed containment lines it could threatened property in the town by tomorrow.

Fires also erupted in Singleton and Colo yesterday, bringing the number of bushfires burning in the state to 67. New blazes at Bega and Eurobodalla were contained.

High temperatures and north to north-west winds today are expected to exacerbate some fires, but a fresh southerly change is forecast by the Bureau of Meteorology for later in the day. The forecast Sydney maximum is 28 degrees.

Meanwhile police and the Rural Fire Service Commissioner, Phil Koperberg, called on people to report suspected arsonists and others seen behaving suspiciously around bushfires.

An arsonist who liked to play with matches was jailed for at least 2 years yesterday after being caught lighting a fire during Canberra's bushfires. 

Dennis Michael Gray, 21, of Red Hill, pleaded guilty in the ACT Supreme Court to intentionally causing a fire on January 22, four days after a firestorm ripped through the national capital, killing four people and destroying more than 500 homes. 

In an earlier court hearing, Australian Federal Police Constable Vince McCarthy said residents spotted Gray lighting a fire in grass near a construction site and tackled him to the ground. 

Constable McCarthy said the fire spread some metres in the long grass and dense foliage before it was put out. 

He said Gray was caught carrying a lighter - which he claimed he needed for smoking - but no cigarettes. He said that Gray denied lighting the fire to police, but spoke of his fascination with fire as a child.",,,,,,,,,,"http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/09/25/1064083130528.html",,

In the neighbouring state of Victoria authorities were planning to drop firefighters into inaccessible parts of the Snowy River National Park to fight some of the 177 forest fires started within the past two days. 

Few of the 80 fires started by lightning strikes on tinder dry trees in the east Victorian forests had been contained, Natural Resources and Environment Department fire coordinator Fabian Crowe said.

Bushfires blazed across a 400-mile arc of eastern Australia yesterday, jumping rivers, swallowing up vast tracts of land and destroying more than 140 houses and properties.

The New South Wales government warned that the fires, which have forced thousands of people to flee their homes over Christmas, could burn out of control for another 10 days. Twenty disaster zones have been declared on the outskirts of Sydney and around the state.

Yesterday flames raced through the Royal National Park, just south of Sydney, at such a ferocious pace that authorities predicted it would be virtually burnt out by the end of today. The park – the world's second oldest national park after Yellowstone in the United States – has already been ravaged twice by bushfires in the past eight years.

The same fire was menacing homes in the city of Wollongong, 56 miles south of Sydney, after passing through coastal settlements such as Waterfall, where the public school was reduced to ash. By yesterday, at least 2,500 people had been evacuated around New South Wales.

About 65 bushfires are raging across the state at present and the main areas of concern are still the lower Hunter region - which bore the brunt of the blazes this weekend - and the Blue Mountains near Bullaburra.

""Our hopes for containment lines managing the fires keep being dashed,"" NSW Rural Fire Service spokesman John Winter said yesterday. 

""The fires are currently burning in valleys which mean they have to come out somewhere but we don't know which way they'll head."" However, there was no immediate threat to property, he said.

High temperatures and low humidity are expected to hinder firefighters with westerly winds predicted to whip up a number of new spot fires.

The Hunter region was the focus of firefighting efforts yesterday especially around Cessnock, Dungog and Foster. Thirteen homes were lost on Saturday in the town of Abernethy, near Cessnock, and thousands of hectares of bushland were destroyed.

A 55-year-old man from Chatswood burned to death after flames engulfed his car near Abernethy at 3.15pm on Saturday. Police, who sealed off the area surrounding the burnt-out car as a crime scene, said many of the fires appeared to have been deliberately lit.

Firefighters worked through the night on Saturday to try to contain that blaze, but backburning operations were not as successful as authorities had hoped due to high humidity.

Three helicopters were in operation in the Hunter region, each carrying 3000 litres of water. One giant helitanker was also used. ""[People believe] it's not a real fire until you have a helitanker,"" Mr Winter said.

A fire in Queensland also jumped the border into NSW yesterday but was burning in national parks away from private property. There are also fires near the northern NSW town of Tenterfield.

All walking trails in national parks around the Sydney basin were shut at the weekend. The NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service said trails in the Royal National Park, Blue Mountains and Kanangra Boyd National Parks and all parks north of Sydney as far north as Gosford had been closed.

Meanwhile, a bushfire which killed a woman and destroyed six homes on the NSW-Queensland border has finally been contained. 

The blaze burnt out more than 30,000 hectares before being contained within control lines near the township of Eukey. It broke out on Thursday near Ballandean, south of Stanthorpe, killing 42-year-old mother of four Sharon Paten.

The fire, burning through forest and farmland 70km south-east of Perth, had yesterday razed 14 houses near Dwellingup.

A school teacher in her mid-20s was also killed on Saturday when her car rolled as she fled a fire near Toodyay, about 85km north-east of Perth. 

Bushfire incident controller Roger Armstrong said the fired burned through a rural sub-division last night, devastating an additional 12,000ha, as it travelled west from Dwellingup.

""Fortunately we were able to pull it up about three kilometres short of Coolup,"" he told Channel 7.

""We've confirmed 14 houses have been burnt, we are not too sure at this stage about the losses that we may have encountered from last night. It did burn through a sub-division. 

""We've got powerlines down which is isolating the town of Dwellingup from the power grid. They are currently running on generator power, and it's affected their water supply as well."" 

Fires at North Yunderup, Greenfields and Parkland had also affected three transmission lines and cut power to another 56,000 properties. 

The fires were preventing maintenance crews reaching the transmission lines to assess the damage and begin repairs.

More than 250 firefighters were battling the flames. 

It was unclear how the fire that threatened Coolup started, Mr Armstrong said.

People with asthma, lung and heart disease, and chronic respiratory conditions should closely monitor their symptoms and, where necessary, stay in air-conditioned buildings to reduce their exposure to smoke particles in the air, the NSW Health Department warns. 

Dr Vicky Sheppeard , director of environmental health, said symptoms from smoke, such as shortness of breath, wheezing, coughing or chest pain, could occur up to five days after smoke was inhaled. 

A hazy layer of brown smoke hung over most parts of Sydney yesterday, blown south from back-burning at St Albans in the Hawkesbury area that started on Wednesday.

Visibility was reduced to half a kilometre and five international flights and at least five domestic flights were diverted from Sydney Airport. 

The smoke was so dense that fire alarms were triggered in buildings in the CBD, including the ABC building at Ultimo, where staff were evacuated at midday. 

The director of atmospheric science at the Environmental Protection Authority, Chris Eiser, said such pollution levels had not been experienced since the 1994 bushfires. 

But because pollution reached the maximum level able to be measured by available equipment, the real level could be much worse, he said. 

``The levels look pretty much the same, but it looks like the worst day ever for Sydney pollution."" 

The pollution index, which measures the loss of visibility due to smoke and particles in the air, recorded the maximum of 237 throughout Sydney and the Illawarra region. 

Mr Eiser said anything above 50 was considered high pollution. On a normal December day, the levels would be between 20 and 30. 

Normal visibility is about 20 kilometres, but yesterday it was a fraction of that. 

The Premier, Bob Carr, said the smoke made water bombing almost impossible, meaning many of the 66 aircraft allocated to firefighting duties were unable to fly. 

``That's the impact it's had and those that can get up in the air have trouble determining where the fires are,"" he said. ``So the smoke has hindered firefighting today, but that might alleviate as the wind pattern changes."" 

A spokesperson for Sydney Airport said five international arrivals were sent to Brisbane, Melbourne and Canberra between 9am and 10.30am when smoke covered the airport. 

Calls from people suffering breathing problems in Sydney increased, with NSW Ambulance Service officers responding to nine asthmatics. 

A NSW Ambulance Service spokesman, Graeme Field, said particles carried in the smoke, particularly pollen, contributed to respiratory aggravation for the adults, five of whom were taken to hospital. 

``If you go out to your car now there's probably black bits all over it,"" Mr Field said. ``If asthmatics breathe those sorts of particles in, their airways become restricted."" 

Although some city tourists resorted to wearing paper masks over their mouths and noses, the health threat posed by the smoke was limited. 

The director of respiratory medicine at Sydney Children's Hospital, Dr John Morton, said: ``Elderly people and those with chronic emphysema or bronchitis are more at risk than the majority of asthmatics."" 

The head of the NSW Wildlife Information and Rescue Service, Carol MacDougall, said the pollution was affecting animals near the fire areas. 

``Up in the Blue Mountains they're seeing birds fall out of the sky,"" she said. ``The birds are suffering from smoke inhalation and they may not survive."" 

The service's volunteers were yesterday trying to resuscitate native birdlife, such as tawny frogmouth owls, that were found unconscious on the ground in bush and city areas.

``The service is urging all asthmatics to closely monitor their asthma,"" a spokeswoman said. Another ambulance source said a small, although not serious, increase in respiratory emergencies, mostly asthma and emphysema cases, had been detected. 

At Liverpool yesterday morning the authority recorded a smoke particle pollution reading of 235. A similar figure was recorded later at Lidcombe, just outside Olympic Park. 

``This is very high,"" said an authority spokesman, Mr John Dengate, adding that the extraordinary pollution and haze were the result of bushfires. 

``Anything over 50 is high. The last time we had readings this high in Sydney was inthe summer of 1997-98 when Sydney had bad bushfires."" 

By mid-afternoon, winds had pushed the level in south-western Sydney down to 72. But in eastern Sydney the figure soared from 29 in the morning to 219 in the afternoon. 

Sydney's north-west also recorded high pollution levels, rising from 31 in the morning to 89 later. 

A spokesman for the Rural Fire Service, Mr John Winter, said most of Sydney's smoke haze was from one relatively small fire burning in the Holsworthy military range, near Campbelltown. 

``Fires that don't have a lot of heat put up more smoke. Intense fires produce less smoke."" 

The fire, the second in the Holsworthy base in the past month, began in nearby Minto on Monday and spread into the military reserve the next day. 

Yesterday about 50 firefighters and a number of soldiers were working to create a 3.5-kilometre backburn to encircle the blaze, which had already destroyed about 200 hectares of bushland. 

``We are very confident we will be able to contain it,"" Mr Winter said. 

A fire broke out near Dural yesterday afternoon, adding to the smoke haze. 

During the day more than 500 firefighters and 60 water-bombing aircraft battled at least 45 fires around NSW, the worst around Tenterfield and Walcha, in the State's north. 

``We are facing multiple fires in each of those districts,"" Mr Winter said. ``Both Walcha and Tenterfield have each got one fire that has burnt more than 30,000 hectares. Plus both areas also have five or six smaller fires.""

About 15 hectares of bushland was burnt before dozens of firefighters managed to get the blaze under control.

There are also fires burning near Forbes, in the NSW central west, around Port Stephens, Campbelltown, and in the Hunter Valley.

The Environment Protection Authority (EPA) has issued a no-burn order covering Sydney and surrounding regions for today. It is likely to be extended to cover the weekend. 

Health authorities have warned asthmatics to take precautions. 

The pollution was particularly bad in the eastern suburbs. Early yesterday, the pollution index for eastern Sydney reached 232, compared with 245 at the height of the January 1994 bushfires. 

In the south-west it reached 222, and in the north-west 90. Anything above 50 is regarded as high. 

The problem was caused mostly by smoke from massive burns in the Sutherland, Wollongong and Southern Highlands regions, blown over Sydney by a southerly wind on Wednesday night. 

The NSW Fire Brigade headquarters received hundreds of calls from people alarmed by the smoke, which blanketed the city all day. 

Bush fire authorities have taken full advantage of the State's long, dry run - it has not rained in Sydney since July 17 - and cold, calm weather, which has provided them with the best environment in years for controlled burning. 

The Director-General of the NSW Department of Bush Fire Services, Mr Phil Koperberg, said ""tens of thousands of hectares"" of bushland throughout NSW would be torched by the start of summer. 

""More (controlled burning) has been done this year than in any single year for the past 10 years - 10 times more,"" Mr Koperberg said. 

""We learned the lessons of not doing it in January '94 and now, with strict legislation and pragmatic programs, we are doing it properly. It's as much to protect the environment as it is to protect us and our assets. 

""We liaise very closely with the EPA and the Bureau of Meteorology, and we don't blatantly burn when there is a clear potential for blanketing out major population centres, but sometimes the conditions change once we have started the process, and you can't stop it."" 

A spokesman for Hornsby Fire Service said undergrowth surrounding homes near Pennant Hills Park had not been burnt for 30 years.",,,,,,,,,,"http://newsstore.smh.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?page=1&sy=smh&kw=sydney+and+pollution&pb=all_ffx&dt=selectRange&dr=entire&so=relevance&sf=text&sf=headline&rc=20&rm=200&sp=nrm&clsPage=1&docID=news950810_0040_6657",,

The caution came on the eve of what may be Sydney's third day of high pollution readings this week. 

On Monday morning the air pollution level for the north-western suburbs reached 128. Any reading above 50 on the open-ended scale, which measures particle matter in the atmosphere, is considered high. 

In the early hours of yesterday the figure for the same region climbed to 68. 

The EPA responded by calling on people to avoid using vehicles, if at all possible, and to experiment with car pooling. It also appealed to the public to avoid lighting indoor wood-burning fires. 

Later yesterday the pollution peak figure for the north-western and south-western suburbs was measured at 39, a level officially labelled as moderate. 

But a spokesman for the EPA said ""rising levels"" were predicted for today and that the pollution figures could again be high. 

The high readings are being triggered by dry, still air which traps pollution in blankets of cooler air just above the ground. As the day warms, air turbulence breaks up the pollution blanket. 

The spokesman produced figures which suggest that Sydney's air quality has finally started to improve. 

He noted that ozone levels in the air over Sydney had exceeded the National Health and Medical Research Council's goal of 0.12 parts per million on just four days in 1992, compared with five in 1987, 10 in 1983 and 12 in 1979. 

He also said lead levels in the atmosphere had been declining slowly since 1985, when unleaded petrol was introduced. 

The spokesman claimed that visibility due to atmospheric pollution had only dropped below the recommended floor in Sydney on 30 days in 1992, compared with 80 in 1986, 91 in 1984, 105 in 1982, 112 in 1981 and 117 in 1980. 

But he warned that all the gains could easily be reversed by the city's increasing love affair with cars. 

""It is estimated that the kilometres travelled by Sydney's motor vehicles will increase by 30 per cent over the next 25 years,"" he said. 

""Our biggest concern is vehicle numbers ... if they continue going up there is going to be a turnaround in air pollution levels."" 

Dr Steve McPhail, the manager of the EPA's three-year, $10 million Metropolitan Air Study now under way, agreed that simply introducing tougher vehicle and industry emission controls would not be enough. 

He said the Sydney Oxidant Study, completed in the 1970s, was the origin of moves to take lead out of petrol and forced the introduction of catalytic converters on new cars to reduce many toxic vehicle emissions. 

""They were the easy solutions,"" Dr McPhail said. ""We are starting to run out of those."" 

He said the EPA was planning to produce an air quality management plan which would be based on the findings of the air quality study, expected to be completed in about 18 months. 

The study is exploring urban planning options, as well as improved emission controls, as ways to curb air pollution. 

""It will look much more at planning,"" said Dr McPhail. 

""It will look at things like putting people closer to where they work so they travel fewer kilometres, and urban consolidation."" 

The air quality study will produce inventories of where Sydney's pollution comes from, investigate the chemistry that is going on in the sky over the city and explore the links between the pollution levels and health problems in Sydney. 

The spokesman said the EPA was also working with the Roads and Traffic Authority to find an ""accurate and affordable"" emission test that could be used to check cars being re-registered.

""With high temperatures and gusty winds, the conditions were particularly dangerous. That is why it is so important that anything out of the ordinary should be phoned through,"" Mr Stevens said.

Eighteen were burnt down on the Gold Coast and Sunshine Coast hinterlands and two were destroyed near Coffs Harbour as 10 bushfires raged out of control in NSW. 

The winds have left a trail of destruction, likely to reach $10 million, across eastern Australia. 

They reached almost 100 km/h yesterday, damaging hundreds more houses and scores of cars. This followed Sunday's heavy toll, including dozens of injuries and the life of a Sydney woman, killed at Kiama when her boyfriend's motorcycle was blown in front of an oncoming car. 

A ferry was driven aground in Sydney Harbour and a light aircraft was flipped on its back after landing in the Hunter Valley yesterday. 

Operations at Sydney Airport were affected for the second day, precluding parallel runway use and causing many flight delays. 

One blaze, 38 kilometres west of Coffs Harbour, flared up in 2,000 hectares of the Wild Cattle Creek State Forest at Bobo Creek. There are numerous alternative-lifestyle dwellings within the area and the Department of Bush Fire Services chief, Commissioner Phil Koperberg, said last night that the safety of those residents was of concern. 

Two unoccupied houses were destroyed there late yesterday and last night a family was evacuated from the nearby Little Nymboida Creek area by a Westpac Rescue helicopter. 

Bushfire emergencies have been declared in the northern NSW local government areas of Coffs Harbour, Kyogle and Ulmarra. At Lake Innes, near Port Macquarie, a fire which has been burning in peat for a number of weeks flared up yesterday under strong winds. It threatened several houses, damaging one property, before being turned by bushfire volunteers. 

A one-kilometre stretch of the Pacific Highway was closed 15 kilometres south of Grafton last night when a fire burning over 3,500 hectares jumped the bitumen. 

In Sydney, 200 weary firefighters finally gained control of a fierce blaze, started by an arsonist, which threatened up to 50 homes in the Fox Valley area of the Lane Cove River National Park at Thornleigh, Wahroonga and South Turramurra on Sunday and early yesterday. 

An angry Superintendent John Anderson, the Hornsby Shire fire controller, said: ""In the last three months over 24 deliberately lit fires have been reported in the Pennant Hills, Thornleigh and Westleigh areas. We believe that one or two people are responsible for all these fires."" 

Firefighters were patrolling the perimeter of the fire last night in case it flared up under gusting and eddying winds. 

The strong winds pushed a Sydney-Parramatta Rivercat, the Dawn Fraser, ashore after the ferry lost its steering while leaving the Watsons Bay wharf about 1.15 pm with six passengers aboard. The grounded catamaran sustained superficial hull damage. 

Insurance assessors were tallying the damage throughout the day, with the Insurance Council of Australia saying the bill was about $5 million for 2,000-odd house-damage claims lodged yesterday in NSW, Victoria and Queensland(where 10 houses have been destroyed by bushfires). 

The total bill is expected to double by the end of the week.",,,,,,,,,,"http://newsstore.smh.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?page=1&sy=smh&kw=sydney+and+bushfire&pb=all_ffx&dt=selectRange&dr=entire&so=relevance&sf=text&sf=headline&rc=20&rm=200&sp=nrm&clsPage=1&docID=news941108_0101_5140",,

Constable McCarthy said the fire spread some metres in the long grass and dense foliage before it was put out.

Firefighters fear the blaze could flare up again because of today's intense weather conditions, said Fire and Emergency Services Authority spokesman Craig Waters.

Already, Perth is choking from the worst pollution ever recorded in the city - caused by a smoke haze which has blanketed the metropolitan area since Wednesday.

The Hills fire is the worst in Perth in 45 years.

FESA said today it was keeping a full fire-fighting crew in the Hills.

""It is a big worry with the high temperatures and the gusty winds,"" Mr Waters said.

""The possibility of the fire flaring up and restarting is very real.""

Perth is expected to top 40 degrees today.

Yesterday, a new task force of firefighters from the volunteer bush fire brigade and the Conservation and Land Management department joined career firefighters in 24 fire-fighting vehicles to patrol the blaze.

AdvertisementThe fire had threatened hundreds of homes in semi-rural areas including Mundaring, Chidlow, Sawyers Valley, and Mahogany Creek, prompting warnings to residents living within 100 metres of bushland to remain on alert for further outbreaks.

For the past few days, Perth has been shrouded in smoke as firefighters work round the clock to consolidate containment lines ahead of the predicted rise in temperatures this weekend.

The smoke haze that has blanketed the metropolitan area since Wednesday was yesterday confirmed as the worst pollution ever recorded in the city.

The Department of Environment's air quality division said the smoke pollution levels were, at times, more than twice the national standard of 50 micrograms per cubic metre.

Meanwhile, officers also battled a bushfire in Perth's northern suburbs overnight that is believed to have been deliberately lit.

The fire at Carramar broke out about 3pm (WST) yesterday, nearby to a pine plantation, Mr Waters said.

Although no homes were threatened by the blaze, officers would have had a hard job fighting the fire if it had reached the plantation, he said.

""Fortunately, it was brought under control and we have crews there now mopping up but the pine plantation was under threat at one stage,"" he said.

Southerly winds are expected to reach gusts of up to 50 kilometres an hour tonight which is likely to cause the fire to cross a creek in the Garigal National Park and burn towards the suburbs of Davidson and Belrose. 

Andrew Shea from the New South Wales Rural Fire Service says fluctuating conditions are hampering efforts to contain the blaze to the southern fringes of the National Park.

Last night, firefighters were dug in along a line separating Forestville from the neighbouring suburb of Davidson, tackling the fire in Sydney's north.

NSW Rural Fire Service (RFS) spokesman John Winter said that fire was now ""all but contained"".

""We have a little more work to do this morning but we're optimistic that we'll hold the (containment) line on that,"" he said.

Fire crews' swift response to the blaze early yesterday afternoon had prevented property loss.

""They got there extremely quickly last night,"" Mr Winter said.

""The only damage was to one house and was minor.


Milder conditions and light rain in the Sydney area late on Thursday and early on Friday have helped the RFS extinguish the blaze near Londonderry Road at Londonderry, which destroyed numerous trucks, cars and sheds but no properties on Thursday.

""We have had crews on the fire grounds overnight monitoring the fires and they will continue to monitor them throughout the day,"" RFS spokesman Anthony Clark said.

The blaze in Mount Kuring-gai in Sydney's north had also been contained, a spokeswoman for NSW Fire Brigades told AAP, with patrols working to ensure there were no further flare-ups.

""They've still got a lot of smoke in the area and there's little stumps still smouldering, but basically it's all over and done with,"" she said.

The blaze, at the rear of a factory complex on Gundah Road, resulted in the evacuation of workers at 15 factories and destroyed a silo at the Artarmon Joinery, which stored wood chips.

The only fire still burning out of control in the state was at an air force bombing range at Evans Head on the NSW north coast.

The state's north had not yet been blessed with the cool change and rain that has bought relief to the state's western and southern areas, RFS spokesman Keiran Smith said.

""That's not expected to reach until later this afternoon,"" he said.

""There'll still be hot, dry conditions until then.""

The RFS were backburning in the area on Friday morning in an attempt to contain the blaze, which forced some campers to be relocated on Thursday.

A grass fire within a bomb impact zone of the army range in Singleton in the Hunter Valley was also continuing to smoulder and the army was monitoring the blaze, Mr Smith said.

The RFS had had difficulties fighting the Singleton fire because they had been unable to enter the army base due to a risk of unexploded ordinance, he said.

But he said there was no reason to believe that the fire had been caused by army bombs or ordinance.

""The fire was near the boundary of the army base there but there are no reports of how it started,"" he said.

The Department of Defence, which is now managing the situation, has not immediately replied to a request for information.

The RFS said hundreds of lightning strikes across the state on Thursday could have started new fires.

""We have aircraft up now monitoring remote areas of the state to see if there are any smoke columns coming from those lightning strikes,"" Mr Smith said.

""We know the one in Lithgow (in central western NSW) is already contained.

""The one at Braidwood (in the state's south), we haven't heard any reports of that escalating but we'll obviously monitor that with aircraft,"" he added.

Wildfires are a natural annual event in Australia, but this year is one of the worst in living memory, a combination of scorching weather, a lack of rain and tinder-dry bush.

Local media have said it is a ""once in a century heatwave"" and among the worst in living memory.

Officials said said dozens of fires were blazing across the country's densely populated southeast, and police said at least one that hit Sydney's metropolitan area late on Friday had been deliberately lit.

As temperatures in Melbourne soared to 45 degrees Celsius (113 Fahrenheit) on Saturday, a major fire east of the city had burned more than 160 hectares of parkland after jumping containment lines overnight.

Authorities warned nearby residents to be on alert and a Reuters photographer at the scene said aircraft were water-bombing spot fires that were breaking out ahead of the main front.

""It is extremely dry. We do have some concern about the winds picking up and having an impact on the fire,"" a spokesman for Victoria state's Country Fire Authority told Reuters.

An ""urgent threat message"" was posted for local communities to be prepared to be hit by fire. Threat notices were also issued for several other areas, while another fire which broke out in the morning was close to the main highway between Melbourne and Sydney.

In New South Wales, authorities said more than 40 fires were burning, with bushfire emergencies declared in several places. Smoke covered many areas of Sydney, which came under threat from two fires late on Friday.

ARSON SUSPECTED

Police blamed a fire that broke out in the inner-Sydney district of Lane Cove on Friday night on arson. The fire burnt several hectares of a national park within the Sydney metropolitan area, threatening nearby homes.

Researchers say around half of the bushfires in Australia are deliberately lit.

Another fire in the Wollemi national park, the home of the famous 'living fossil', the Wollemi pine, had destroyed 1,000 hectares of forest northwest of Sydney, a spokeswoman for the New South Wales state Rural Fire Service told Reuters.

""The fire is moving quite quickly,"" spokeswoman Rebel Talbert said, adding that a bushfire emergency had been declared there and aircraft with water bombs were trying to bring it under control.

Another blaze near the coast south of Sydney had jumped containment lines and was proving hard to control. Authorities in South Australia said they were tackling a fire near the southern community of Mount Gambier.

As far as the eye can't see … Sydney's recent haze has been the result of a low-level temperature inversion in which higher-level warm air traps moisture and pollution below.

Dorothea Mackellar loved a ""wide brown land"", but she was not talking about the rust-coloured haze that smothered Sydney yesterday.

As the temperature rose to 21 degrees, four more than the average maximum for the month, an otherwise fine day was spoilt by a spreading layer of heavy air pollution.

A Bureau of Meteorology spokesman, Tim Edwards, said the smog had been caused by ""low-level inversion"". Normally the air cooled about one degree for every 100 metres of altitude, he said. But on still winter nights the layer of air in contact with the ground became colder than the air above it.

""The upper warm layer traps the moisture and pollution close to the ground. It's in the first few hundred metres above the earth,"" Mr Edwards said. ""It's not uncommon in winter, but it doesn't usually last for long.""

In some parts of Sydney visibility had briefly dropped to as low as 300 metres.

The Environment Protection Authority said pollution levels in central and eastern Sydney were in the high part of the medium band, and almost double levels in south-west Sydney.

AdvertisementA spokesman said pollution particles became coated in a fine layer of moisture, which refracted sunlight and made the particles seem much bigger. This, in turn, exaggerated the brown haze.

But the rising sun would warm the lower air and cause the water around the pollution particles to evaporate, making the haze fade.",,,,,,,,,,"http://www.smh.com.au/news/National/The-truth-about-seasons-of-mists-and-mellow-fruitfulness/2005/06/06/1117910243485.html",,

Temperatures reached up to 44 degrees Celsius (111 F) in some areas, and firefighters were battling scores of blazes, although authorities said cooler weather and rain had brought relief to South Australia and Victoria.

In New South Wales, Australia's most populous state, residents were evacuated from two small communities near Gosford, about 60 km (37 miles) north of Sydney, where three homes and some vehicles were destroyed by flames more than 20 metres (65 ft) high.

""Black smoke covering the sun, just scorching hot, 44 degrees. It's burning up here,"" Mitchell, a local resident told Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio.

Major roads leading north from Sydney, Australia's biggest city, were closed, disrupting holidaymakers. Serious fires and evacuations were reported in several other areas, and one man was airlifted to hospital with burns after a fire in western New South Wales.

Thousands of firefighters were put on high alert before the extreme weather conditions and a ban on lighting fires in the open was in effect across New South Wales, much of Victoria and South Australia.

""The fires are widespread and breaking out right across the state,"" said New South Wales Rural Fire Service spokesperson Rebel Talbert.

GUSTS

A southerly cool change swept through Sydney late in the evening, bringing wind gusts of up to 110 km an hour, but was expected to help firefighters contain blazes on Monday.

In western Victoria, where a large bushfire destroyed seven homes near Stawell late on Saturday, rain helped firefighters contain the blaze that burnt out about 9,000 hectares (22,000 acres) of scrub and farmland.

Australia is scarred by bushfires every summer and every few years bushfires blaze into major cities which have fingers of bushland weaving through suburbs.

In January 2004, the deadliest bushfires in 22 years killed nine people and injured dozens in South Australia. The blazes were the worst since Ash Wednesday bushfires claimed 75 lives in South Australia and Victoria in 1983.

In 2003, bushfires destroyed a slice of Australia nearly three times the size of Britain, fuelled by one of the worst droughts in a century. Four people were killed and 530 homes destroyed when fire swept through the capital, Canberra, that year.

In 2002 and 1994, bushfires destroyed scores of homes in Sydney.",,,,,,,,,,"http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/index.html?siteSect=143&sid=6354001&cKey=1136074821000",,

Rural Fire Service (RFS) spokesman Cameron Wade said 24 bushfires in NSW were all under control.

But with hot dry conditions prevailing across the state, a total fire ban has been issued for the Hunter, north western, upper and lower central western plains, southern slopes, Riverina, far western and south western fire districts.

It will remain in force until midnight (AEDT).

The temperature in Sydney was expected to reach 37 degrees Celsius, and up to 39 degrees in the western suburbs.

""Sydney has got away a little bit because of the cloud cover,"" Mr Wade said.

""Out west it's 39 degrees, with 60kph winds and high humidity.

""That's why we are keeping a close eye on it. If we get new fires in these conditions they can flare up very quickly.""

He said firefighters were prepared to jump on any outbreaks.

""It is a matter now of waiting to see what the weather does - making sure new fires are quickly brought under control and that burning fires don't break containment lines,"" Mr Wade said.

A 6,000 hectare fire is still burning in the Pilliga forest, near Narrabri in north-western NSW, after it flared up again late Tuesday.

A large bushfire was also burning in bushland at Wagga Wagga after breaking out about midday.

Of the 24 fires burning statewide, only two to three were caused by lightning, meaning the others were lit, either accidentally or deliberately, Mr Wade said.

A cooler, gusty change is predicted but temperatures will climb again on Thursday.

Huge numbers of emergency personnel were deployed across the state as temperatures soared. Last night firefighters were battling to save homes on the Central Coast as 80 km/h winds fanned fires that had already destroyed three houses in Woy Woy and forced hundreds of residents to evacuate.

Residents were forced to flee, some by boat, as seven fires burnt in the area. Last night three were still burning. Fires in Belrose, Spencer, Appin and Merimbula, which had earlier threatened homes, had been contained but fire authorities were worried about strong southerly winds.

A farmer was last night flown from Junee to Concord Hospital, which houses one of the state's main burns units. He would go into intensive care immediately, a spokeswoman said.

Forty-four blazes were reported across the state as temperatures topped 45 degrees in some areas of Sydney, fanned by strong north-westerly winds.

A home on the outskirts of Junee was destroyed and eight cars were burnt out at the volunteer firefighters' headquarters at Phegan's Bay while firefighters were out battling the flames. About 45 aircraft had been used to fight fires.

It was unclear how many hectares had been burnt or were still burning.

More than 300 firefighters and up to seven water-bombing aircraft were battling to contain the flames, with support crews from Sydney rushing north.

The F3 freeway from Sydney to Newcastle, which had been closed earlier in the day, was opened southbound to clear a backlog of traffic, with fears that an imminent wind change could threaten thousands of stranded motorists. It was closed again about 8pm.

In an ominous sign for the summer ahead and vindicating recent warnings by authorities that the fire season would start early and be severe, wild fires fanned by hot winds of up to 100kph broke out in more 50 locations in the state.

The bushfires and winds caused power blackouts to more than 100,000 homes in the southern highlands, Western Sydney and the south coast and burned out more than 2,000 hectares of bushland.

Electricity was also cut to areas in Sydney's north and west, the Blue Mountains, and Central Coast.

A 52-year-old motorcyclist died when his bike was struck by a tree branch which fell during strong winds at Kangaroo Valley, on the south coast.

Four houses were razed near Picton, south-west of Sydney, and at least two more were destroyed near Cattai, in Sydney's north-west.

A woman was airlifted to Sydney's Liverpool Hospital after a tree branch fell on her at Thirlmere, near Picton.

She suffered neck and head injuries and was reported to be in a stable condition.

Five fires were also burning in the Hunter Valley, one of which came within several hundred metres of property at Redhead, an outer southern suburb of Newcastle.

Homes at Burrill Lake, near Ulladulla, in the Shoalhaven district on NSW's south coast were evacuated this morning as a large fire approached.

NSW Rural Fire Service (RFS) Commissioner Phil Koperberg said today's fire conditions were almost unprecedented for September.

""We've not had a day like this in September in history,"" he told ABC Television.

""Winds were over 100kph for much of the day and it was a very, very difficult day for firefighters.""

Conditions were improving tonight as temperatures dropped and cooler weather was expected in most affected areas tomorrow.

Firefighters were beginning backburning in many areas.

Residents in fire-affected areas were urged to remain on alert throughout the night in case spotfires broke out.

Hundreds of firefighters were involved in battling the blazes but aerial waterbombing was hampered because of treacherous winds.

Two firefighters who fought the bushfire near Redhead were taken to hospital and treated for minor burns and smoke inhalation.

A man and his two sons watched helplessly as his family home south west of Sydney was torn apart by fire.

The 59-year-old asked not to be named because his mother, who owns the house, is in a nursing home and has not been told the property has been destroyed.

The home was engulfed in flames just after 2pm (AEST) after a bushfire fanned by winds over 60kph swept through the area.

The man said he arrived at the house on Bakers Lodge Road in Oakdale near Wollondilly about 3pm today but two chimneys were all that remained.

Speaking next to the burning structure, he said he only had time to save two of his mother's three chickens in a nearby pen.

""I just looked around to see what was what,"" he said.

""This has always been home base.

""I don't know how to break the news to her (my mother).

A receptionist at the Redhead Bowling Club near the centre of the small coastal town said the fire burned precariously close to homes.

""It's about 100 metres away, and my house is about four houses up,"" she said.

""I can't really see too much, apart from the smoke.""

The bushfires and high winds caused power blackouts for more than 150,000 homes in parts of western and northern Sydney, the Blue Mountains and the central and south coasts.

A spokeswoman for Integral Energy said the strong winds were hampering repair crews and many customers might have to wait until tomorrow for power to be restored.

The State Emergency Service said it had received more than 2,000 calls for assistance - mostly for wind damage to properties, in Sydney, the Blue Mountains, Hunter Valley and South Coast.

Extra SES volunteers from Queanbeyan, Yass, Wagga Wagga and Namoi are being called in to help deal with the damage.

High temperatures and strong winds have firefighters struggling to control bushfires across NSW today, a Rural Fire Service (RFS) spokesman said.

A fire also has come within 500 metres of property at Redhead, an outer southern suburb of Newcastle, in the Hunter region.

Homes at Burrill Lake, near Ulladulla on the south coast, were being evacuated earlier today as a fire approached, and fires also are burning on the central coast and on the outskirts of Sydney.

RFS spokesman Cameron Wade said Commissioner Phil Koperberg had ordered all the state's rural fire stations to open and bushfire emergencies could be declared at Thirlmere and Redhead.

However, the weather was expected to improve tonight, Mr Wade said.

""The fire was just too fierce,"" a neighbour said.

Two hours later, a woman escaped with minor injuries when she jumped from the second floor of a burning block of units at Maryville, in Newcastle.

A number of properties were under threat, but RFS spokesman Anthony Clark said an early evening southerly had dramatically changed conditions on the fireground. 

""As a result of the wind change (about 5.30pm AEDT) - that southerly coming through gusting at 70km/h - we have seen numerous sheds, trucks and cars destroyed, but no homes,'' he said.

""We did property protection with the residents to defend those homes. 

""We are starting to see that fire activity dropping off there.'' 

A Londonderry resident, who only wanted to be known as Donna, said the fire had been burning close to her home but then the southerly intervened. 

""We were actually not home earlier, we had someone ring and say your street is on fire, you need to get home,'' she said.

""We dropped everything, my husband was on his way home from work and I was out shopping, and raced home. 

""We were prepared to do what we needed to do.'' 

The RFS praised the efforts of Londonderry residents in preparing their properties for fires.

More than 250 firefighters were sent out to Mt Ku-ring-gai and Londonderry, near Penrith, yesterday afternoon as strong southerly winds and lightning strikes fuelled blazes in both areas.

The Rural Fire Service said both fires had been contained overnight with the help of a cool change and no properties were under threat .

""We've even experienced some light rain at [Mt Ku-ring-gai and Londonderry] overnight,"" an RFS spokesman said.

Fire crews are still out at both sites today to monitor the fires and begin the clean up phase.

""Today the conditions are much milder compared to yesterday so we'll have crews in attendance at these fires once again, mopping up and putting out any pockets of fire,"" the spokesman said.

At Londonderry, farm buildings and vehicles were left as burnt-out shells after the fire front passed through properties along Whitegates Road and The Northern Road between 1pm and 3pm. About 110 firefighters from both the Rural Fire Service and the NSW Fire Brigades were able to ward the fire away from homes with the help of two water-bombing aircraft. The danger to property had eased by about 6.30pm.

The blaze may have started in or near a shed on Whitegates Road, the Rural Fire Service said last night.

The native Australian conifers, from the Jurassic era, were discovered only in 1994 in a still-secret canyon in the Wollemi National Park, in the Blue Mountains area on Sydney's outskirts, and remain extremely rare.

Firefighters were building fire-breaks around sections of the remote forest and would throw in all the resources required to save the ancient trees, including use of aircraft, Rural Fire Service spokeswoman Rebel Talbot told Reuters on Saturday.

""We'll do whatever it takes,"" she said.

For weeks now thousands of firefighters have battled more than 50 blazes in New South Wales and Victoria states after one of Australia's worst droughts on record created tinderbox conditions. Blazes also broke out in remote areas of South Australia on the weekend.

Firefighters raced against the clock near Sydney, the country's most populous city, to contain fires ahead of predicted hot, gusty weather next week.

""Our volunteers are working 12-hour shifts, seven days a week, 24-hours a day,"" New South Wales Rural Fire Services Commissioner Phil Koperberg said on ABC radio on Saturday.

""There are some 3,500 people involved in the operation (and) a total of about 24 aircraft,"" he said. Firefighters are using bulldozers, tankers and other heavy equipment to combat the blazes.

One major fire in the Hunter Valley, which includes Wollemi National Park around 200 km (125 miles) northwest of Sydney, had burnt out more than 53,000 hectares (131,000 acres) of bushland.

The blaze was very large and in a remote, inaccessible area, Talbot said.

Another fire in the Blue Mountains, around 100 km west of Sydney, has burnt around 14,000 ha of mainly national park land.

On Saturday 12 fires were raging in New South Wales, including one in the Hawkesbury area, around 70 km north of Sydney.

Hot, windy weather on Saturday thwarted attempts to contain the Blue Mountains and Hawkesbury fires. Firefighters faced the prospect of working through the night to backburn forest litter.

""The winds picking up this afternoon will cause some issues for us as well as warmer temperatures.

""So all the conditions combining can make it quite difficult.''

An uncontained fire covering 100 hectares in Wingecarribee region, south of Sydney, was causing the most concern, he said.

Helicopters were being used to douse the fire, and 20 firefighters and National Parks workers were on the scene.

The storm, which is heading for the NSW eastern seaboard, including Sydney, has kept State Emergency Service (SES) crews busy in western NSW with winds over 100 km/h tearing roofs off buildings and felling trees.

More than 150 requests for help have been made to the SES because of wind damage, abut 100 of them coming from the Broken Hill area.

There are still 65 fires burning throughout New South Wales state, while the cost of the Sydney bushfire emergency is expected to be well over A$100 million.

Black Xmas 

Last Christmas a wall of flames ringed Sydney and the fire service has been warning since the first fires flared up in the winter month of July that this fire season could be far worse.

While officials cautiously hope the worst of the 2002 fires might be over, residents who lost homes face a bleak Christmas, saying it could take years to repair their shattered lives.

Blue Mountains antique dealer Jim Baillie vowed to rebuild his Swiss-style chalet after a ferocious fire on Sunday gutted the top floors and sweeping staircase, destroying vintage collections.

Giant helitankers used to douse the flames left Baillie's full-sized snooker table covered in water and ash and charred bronze statues and burnt out canvasses strewn across sodden stinking carpet.

""You always think it's never going to happen to you, you always think it'll happen to someone else,"" shift worker Baillie said from inside the charred shell of a house.

Rural Fire Service Commissioner Phil Koperberg said there was still plenty of work for the 4,500 firefighters, cleaning up and working on containment lines to keep fires still alight in check.

""In Sydney...the problem is dissipating,"" Koperberg said.

""I have to tell you that the firefighters will be out there for many, many days yet performing the arduous, dirty, labour-intensive task of mopping up,"" he told reporters.

The latest fires have burnt 120,000 hectares in New South Wales. By end-November, a total of 470,000 hectares in New South Wales had been scorched.

The fires last Christmas burned through 770,000 hectares and destroyed 109 houses around Sydney.

Fires are natural to the arid bush, with December and January usually the worst months, but urban sprawl has blurred the barrier between metropolitan Australia and the outback.

Beach crowds have been down and air-conditioning retailers have been struggling.

Adding insult to injury, Sydney was wrapped yesterday in the greyish-blue blanket of Victoria's smoke haze, blown hundreds of kilometres across NSW by south-westerly winds.

The eerie mix of smoke, whipped up by fires ravaging Victoria, and cloud was trapped over Sydney by a temperature inversion, in which air close to the ground is colder than the atmosphere above.

""People are smelling smoke. We have been having a lot of inquiries,"" said Elly Spark, a senior forecaster at the Bureau of Meteorology. ""There is smoke right across Canberra and the Southern Tablelands.""

Visibility had been reduced to eight kilometres, she said.

Although last year was one of Sydney's four warmest on record, last month saw the city's coldest December days since 1999 and the coolest December nights since 1996.

That has made chilly news for the air-conditioning trade. Lok Subedi, of Harvey Norman's Moore Park shop, said air-conditioner sales, which picked up in November, slumped with summer's arrival.

""Since December it has been down,"" he said. ""It hasn't been good at all. We have a drop of probably 70 per cent.""

The manager at Bing Lee's Pitt Street Mall store, Sreesha Sounderam, confirmed the trend. ""There is a definite drop in the number of air-conditioning units we're selling so far this summer, and it's definitely because of the weather,"" he said.

""Normally I would say that we sell around 50 air-conditioners a month, but this time around we've only sold maybe 20 or 30.""

Sydneysiders who already have air-conditioners may have been leaving them off. EnergyAustralia's spokesman, Anthony O'Brien, said electricity use last month was six per cent down on December 2005.

Rural Fire Service (RFS) firefighters today worked on securing the southeastern corner of the blaze, which was burning in rugged terrain near North Turramurra, East Wahroonga, and St Ives Chase.

Aided by today's cooler temperatures, helicopters water-bombed the area before firefighters moved in with hoses.

The fire, which is 90 per cent contained, has ripped through more than 1000ha of bush in the Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park since it began at about 5pm (AEDT) on Sunday.

Commuters were stranded for up to five hours yesterday while the Pacific Highway, F3 freeway and railway lines north of Sydney were closed because of poor visibility.

Kuring-gai Local Area Commander, Superintendent Rex Little, today said police were investigating the origins of the fire.

“The problem with a lot of fires is that your crime scene has been destroyed by the actual fire,” Supt Little said.

“The state of NSW has seen a number of occasions where fires have been deliberately lit.

“We don't discount that but at the same time, we're not here to say that is definitely the case in this matter.” 

Supt Little said the fire was believed to have started near the Berowra Railway Station and that some calls had been received from the public with information about its origins.

“I think we could rule out a campfire (because) the area where we believe the fire started is not an area where you have campers,” Supt Little said.

AdvertisementFirefighters have warned the northern Sydney suburb of Berowra is likely to come under threat from a bushfire at Mt Kuring-gai, but say they are confident they can protect the homes in its path.

About 250 firefighters and waterbombing helicopters are battling the fire which started on Sunday, and crews are working to extinguish a spot fire which has sprung up south of the main blaze.

NSW Rural Fire Service (RFS) Assistant Commissioner Rob Rogers said homes in Berowra would come under direct threat if the fire jumped the Pacific Highway.

""I don't believe there is a risk to Berowra itself ... There is obviously the ember attack issue and that's something we can't control - embers can travel hundreds of metres and we can't necessarily see where every ember lands,"" Mr Rogers said.

He said the RFS was using all the necessary resources, including two skycrane helicopters and four medium ""attack helicopters"".

""We've got a lot of airpower on this fire, we've got every single appliance that they have asked for,"" he said.

""It's a huge focus of effort so I'm quite comfortable with the fact that we'll protect property under these conditions.""

He said the suburbs of North Turramurra and Duffys Forest, to the fire's south, also could come under threat with a wind change.

Fire crews have conducted backburning to contain the main blaze on the southern side and will work to establish containment lines on the northern side of the fire near Berowra.

This afternoon, winds are expected to come from the south south-east at speeds of 30km/h to 40km/h.

The bushfire has also forced the closure of train lines between Cowan and Hornsby in Sydney's north, a RailCorp spokesman said.

The train line was closed at 11.15am (AEDT) on advice from the Rural Fire Service, he said.

F3 and Pacific Highway road closures prevented an alternative service for commuters, he said.

""We can't currently put on a replacement bus service,"" the spokesman said.

It was not known when it would be safe for the rail line to reopen.

Emergency Services Minister Tony Kelly said commuters should be prepared for delays if the roads could not be opened before the afternoon peak.

Hornsby Council has set up refuge centres at Berowra and Cowan for commuters who are left stranded.

""If we can't get it opened then obviously there's going to be delays, it'll make it very difficult, and people should look at other alternatives,"" Mr Kelly said.

The NSW Ambulance Service said crews are undertaking welfare checks on motorists stranded because of the F3 and Pacific Highway closures.

Crews will be travelling along both roads between Sydney and the Central Coast and motorists feeling unwell should flag down the ambulances, the NSW Ambulance Service said in a statement.",,,,,,,,,,"http://www.theage.com.au/news/National/Berowra-may-come-under-bushfire-threat/2007/01/22/1169330798790.html",,

Strong winds sent embers ahead of the fire front, threatening more than five semi-rural properties on Lemon Tree Passage Road, between Salt Ash and the road to Oyster Cove.

Fire crews went door-to-door helping residents secure their homes against the firefront, which was about one kilometre upwind from the homes.

The fire had been contained overnight in the area North of Lemon Tree Passage Road, but jumped containment lines when forecast strong winds kicked in just after 1pm today.

Residents and RFS firefighters hosed down houses on the one-hectare properties and doused embers blown in from the fire.

Smoke from the bushfire blew at speed toward the properties, as aerial water bombers flew overhead.

Ruth Higginbottom and her husband Bruce began safeguarding their house from embers after winds picked up this afternoon.

""It's the flying embers that you've really got to worry about,"" Mrs Higginbottom said, pointing a hose at her house.

The couple's neighbours were away on holiday, but had been contacted by the Higginbottoms, who activated a sprinkler system to cover their house with water.

RFS fire crews were also on standby at each of the threatened properties.

The threat to the Lemon Tree Passage Road properties later passed with a wind change and aerial water bombing.

It was caused by one of three spot fires that broke containment lines this afternoon.

Houses in Moffatt Road, at Swan Bay, were under ember attack from a second spot fire that is now burning at the rear boundary of the rural properties.

Water bombing efforts are now being concentrated on Swan Bay, where RFS and NSW Fire Brigades teams are working with residents to protect properties there.

A third spot fire, east of the Medowie township, within the Williamtown air force base, is being controlled and is posing no threat to properties.

Firefighters are hopeful of containing all of these new outbreaks before the strong winds that caused them intensify later tonight.",,,,,,,,,,"http://www.smh.com.au/news/environment/bushfire-jumps-containment-lines-in-port-stephens/2007/10/03/1191091183636.html",,

Three big fires broke out yesterday -- the first day of the official bushfire season -- as hot and blustery conditions combined with forest lands left tinder-dry by Australia's worst-ever drought to raise the danger.

At Tilligerry passage area near Port Stephens, about 200km north of Sydney, a fire covering about 150 hectares razed two houses and several sheds, New South Wales state Rural Fire Service officials said. No injuries were reported.

More than 100 firefighters backed by three helicopters were working on the fire and saved more than 50 other homes, local commander Jason McKeller told ABC.

About 60 campers were moved out of a popular spot in the Ku-ring-gai National Park north of Sydney where another fire was raging in forest land, said Murray Hillan, another fire service official.

A third fire in the Royal National Park south of Sydney was brought under control yesterday after several hours.

Hillan said recent rains may have lulled people into a false sense of security about the risk of fires, which are a regular feature of Australia's summer months, burning thousands of hectares of forests and sometimes blasting into towns and cities with deadly results.

Australia's fire season usually runs until January, as electrical storms and blustery conditions become a feature in the country's southeast.

Downed power cables, discarded cigarettes butts and lightning strikes are more often the causes of such fires than arson, though investigators say a worrying number of fires are deliberately lit.

About 80 firefighters were working on the fire at Evans Head on the state's far North Coast that had burned through almost 5000 hectares of bushland.

Crews supported by aircraft worked along the southern and western edges of the fire to strengthen containment lines.

Neighbouring residents were advised to stay alert in case of deteriorating conditions.

Crews also continued to monitor and patrol containment lines along a large fire at Port Stephens.

Firefighters continued work on the Oyster Cove and Medowie blazes that had burned out more than 2270 hectares of national parkland, private property and water catchment areas.

Aircraft were used to water bomb hot spots in anticipation of the extreme weather conditions that were forecast for yesterday.

Authorities advised residents of Swan Bay, Lillies Point and Karuah to prepare their homes for the onset of fire and decide early whether to stay and defend their properties or evacuate.

There were total fire bans in place in many areas of the state, including the Hunter Valley and Sydney.

Crews contained two fires in Glen Innes, in the state's north, that had burned more than 5500 hectares.

They also worked on blazes at Gloucester, Great Lakes and Taree. Crews were called out to a fire at the Holsworthy Army Base after 1pm, after winds had picked up.

There was partial relief when an afternoon southerly change reduced temperatures, but the accompanying gusty winds were a concern for firefighters.

A southerly change overnight eased temperatures considerably today after record temperatures and strong north-westerly winds combined yesterday to create horror bushfire conditions.

Fire crews will keep an eye on more than 40 blazes across NSW but the Rural Fire Service (RFS) said today the immediate danger had passed for large fires raging north of Sydney, in the Hunter and on the state's north coast.

The respite will be short however as top temperatures of 34 degrees and gusty winds return on Saturday.

""It's certainly over for the moment but we are expecting hot, dry, windy conditions for Saturday,"" RFS spokesman Cameron Wade told the Nine Network.

""So for the next two days fire crews will be mopping up and trying to contain some of the bigger fires across NSW.""

Thousands of peak-hour commuters were stranded yesterday after fire broke out near Cowan, on Sydney's northern outskirts, forcing the closure of major roads and rail links.

The F3 Freeway, the Old Pacific Highway and the rail lines between Sydney, the Central Coast and Newcastle were all closed for several hours.

The Cowan fire was one of about 10 bushfires of major concern to firefighters yesterday.

Firefighters had focused their efforts on a blaze south of Evans Head on the far north coast, several fires in the Port Stephens area, north of Newcastle, and at West Head, just north of Sydney.

A bushfire at Wentworth Falls in the Blue Mountains, and another at Oxford Falls, in Sydney's northern suburbs, and the Cowan blaze rounded out the areas where firefighting efforts were most concentrated.

Two 11-year-old boys were cautioned after allegedly starting the Wentworth Falls fire with a Molotov cocktail.

The Port Stephens and West Head fires are also thought to have been deliberately lit but Mr Wade said negligence rather than arson was most often the cause of the destructive blazes.

""A lot of fires are started by stupidity and carelessness,"" he told Southern Cross Broadcasting.

WA: Heat, winds cause new fire concerns as Perth chokes in haze

By Alison Miller

PERTH, Jan 23 AAP - Soaring temperatures and gusty winds could reignite a deliberately-lit
bushfire that has razed more than 27,000 hectares of land in Perth's Hills area.

Firefighters fear the blaze could flare up again because of today's intense weather
conditions, said Fire and Emergency Services Authority spokesman Craig Waters.

Already, Perth is choking from the worst pollution ever recorded in the city - caused
by a smoke haze which has blanketed the metropolitan area since Wednesday.

The Hills fire is the worst in Perth in 45 years.

WA: Goldfields fires fanned by scorching heat and strong winds 

PERTH, Jan 8 AAP - A massive bushfire was raging out of control today along fronts 
20km-long, after searing 40 degree heat and strong winds fanned the Goldfields blaze over 
the weekend. 

The big fire - an amalgamation of several fires started by lightning a month ago - 
has burned more than 300,000ha of mostly inaccessible scrub north of Coolgardie, 557km 
east of Perth. 

Strong winds and scorching heat fanned the blaze over the weekend, forcing firefighters 
to retreat from the southern front, which had been contained on Friday after it had threatened 
a railway track and two nearby stations ...",,,,,,,,"cross reference with TOMS by Sarah Henderson 9/2/2010:
 There is definitely aerosol around Perth for this whole period, but I can't say whether it is dust alone or dust with smoke.  There does seem to be a persistent fire in southern WA.

Yes...smoke from Coolgardie is definitely reaching Perth on the 5-7th of January, 2001.  It was obviously a very large fire.",,"http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-39075644.html",,
