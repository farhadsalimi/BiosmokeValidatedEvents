# Introduction 

These instructions are for users to access the database to browse or download data.
A password is required and available on request to the corresponding author.

# MS Access

- Download and install the latest version of psqlODBC from: [http://www.postgresql.org/ftp/odbc/versions/msi/](http://www.postgresql.org/ftp/odbc/versions/msi/)
- Please note: If running a 64-bit version of Windows, you will want to download and install BOTH the psqlodbc_XX_XX_XXXX.zip and psqlodbc_XX_XX_XXXX-x64.zip file. 
- Assuming you use the 32 bit windows office suite (recommended) then use the command below to open the ODBC connections tool and add a DSN for your postgres database
- Go to Start -> Run (or Press Windows+R keys) and enter 

```
    %WINDIR%\SysWOW64\odbcad32.exe
```

- On either the User DSN (DSNs available for only that user) or System DSN (DSNs available to every user) tab, click the Add button. Scroll - down the list and find the PostgreSQL ODBC Driver.
- You may select ANSI or UNICODE (For future support I personally prefer UNICODE), and click Finish.
- Data Source refers to the programmable name of the DSN Entry. Stick to lower-case letters and underscores. Ex: psql_server
- Specify the Database, Server, User Name and Password to your PostgreSQL server.
- Click the Test button to ensure everything has been specified correctly.
- Click the Save button to create the DSN.
