\begin{abstract} % abstract
\parttitle{Background} %if any
Epidemiological studies of the health effects of
biomass smoke events (such as bushfires or wood-heater smoke spikes due
to inversion layers) have been hampered by the availability of datasets
that explicitly pertain to these sources. Extreme air pollution events
may also be caused by dust storms, fossil fuel induced smog events or
factory fires. This paper presents an open and extensible database
developed by the authors to identify historical spikes in PM
concentrations and to evaluate whether they were caused by vegetation
fire smoke or by other possible sources. These methods provide a
systematic framework for retrospective identification of the air quality
impacts of biomass smoke in a region that is seasonally affected by
fires. In this paper, we describe the database and data aquisition
methods, as well as analytical considerations when validating historical
events using a range of reference types.

\parttitle{Methods} %if any
 Several major urban centers and smaller regional towns
in the Australian states of New South Wales, Western Australia, and
Tasmania were selected as they are intermittently affected by extreme
episodes of vegetation fire smoke. Air pollution data was collated and
missing values were imputed. Extreme values were identified and a range
of sources of reference information were assessed for each date.
Reference types online newspaper archives, government and research
agency records, satellite imagery and a Dust Storms database.

\parttitle{Results}
This dataset contains validated events of extreme
biomass smoke pollution across Australian cities. The authors have
previously demonstrated the utility of this database in analyses of
hospital admissions and mortality data for these locations to quantify
the pollution-related health effects of these events.

\parttitle{Conclusions}
The database was created using open source
software and this makes the prospect for future extensions to the
database possible. THis is because if other scientists notice an
ommision or error in these data they can offer an amendment. We believe
that this will improve the database and benefit the whole biomass smoke
health research community.

\input{methods}

The LaTeX template needs bibtex style citations, so here is one to ensure the compiler works while creating drafts.  The main paper to cite is \cite{Johnston2011c}.

\section*{Instructions for Accessing the Database}

The Database can be accessed by the pgAdmin tool for PostgreSQL databases, the R software or by using ODBC and MS Access.  The latter method is the recommended way to view the data entries using Forms stored in the MS Access database provided with the downloadable materials.  A Password is available on request to the corresponding author.

An additional document shows the instructions to access the database in more detail [see Additional file 1].
